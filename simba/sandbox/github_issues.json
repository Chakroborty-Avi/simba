Should videos be preprocessed as shown in the simba tutorial, then run through SLEAP, and then also be used in simba? In other words, is the expectation that the processed videos are the ones used for pose estimation and then behavioral classification?",

                "body": "Hi @SnowySnowySnowy !\r\n\r\nShort answer Yes. \r\n\r\nTLDR: Preprocessing is for when recordings are made in less-than-optimal conditions for pose-estimation and is used to improve pose-estimation. Better input data gives between classifications. Often parts captured in videos are areas outside arena which animal can never reach, some cable that could be mistaken for a tail is there, or early captured portions can feature the experimenters hands in images etc., mucking up the pose-estimation performance and later classifications. The resolution and FPS may be also unnecessarily high introducing long pose-estimation and classification runtimes and unnecessary large disk space requirements. \r\n\r\nMuch can be fixed by clipping/cropping/re-sampling the videos, and you want to do this before performing pose-estimation. \r\n\r\nIf you performed pose-estimation, then resampled the videos, and imported the resampled videos but the original pose-estimation to SimBA, there could be issues in visualization components in SimBA. For example, the nose could be pose-estimated at pixel location (1600, 800). However, your cropped videos are only 800 by 600 large so 1600x600 is outside the image. If you re-sampled the FPS then there would be a similar mixup in time domain so you see the pose-estimation moving much quicker then the actual animal etc.\r\n",

Before running machine model, I am creating the probability plots and checking the frames. I am setting a value just with my opinion. When I check the sklearn results I am still seeing some positive or negative errors. \r\nIs there any statistical approach are you using or suggesting for setting the thresholds?\r\n\r\nThanks!",

However, this will potentially come at the expense of introducing false negatives. \r\n\r\n * If the classifications are generally too conservative (too many false negatives), **decrease** the classification threshold. However, this will potentially come at the expense of introducing false positives.\r\n\r\nIf it is the case that you cannot get satisfactory results by titrating the discrimination threshold, it is possible that the behavior videos you are visualizing differ somewhat from the behavior in the videos you annotated and used to train the classifier? Do you see anything particular with the instances of the behavior where the classifier misses it and wrongly classifies it as behavior present? Is it possible to include these behavioral events when the classifier gets it wrong as correctly annotated examples in your annotated dataset and retrain the classifier with this additional information?  \r\n\r\n\r\n",

This ensures that SimBA computes the same features that the models expects. If you have different body-parts configurations, SimBA will compute different features and a different number of features, and the models will be confused what to do with the additional / missing features and throw you an error. To use these models, use this setting when creating your project:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"437\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-06-11 at 8 51 24 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/assets/34761092/72cc3a14-0ea5-45e7-be9c-f4b6469175c8\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. One possibility that it “freezes”, is that the example script is expecting data columns that don’t exist in your data, and it errors out. If it errors out in a way that I haven’t yet been able to anticipate, no errors will be printed in the main SimBA interface. Instead, an error message from the standard python library will be printed in the main terminal which you used to launch SimBA. If you look in the terminal that you used to launch SimBA, do you see any error msg printed? \r\n\r\n\r\n3. On the difference between the SLEAP data, and the format in SimBA where the SLEAP data is transposed. When you import your data into SimBA, the data lands in the `project_folder/csv/input_csv` within your SimBA project. After you perform outlier correction (or skip to perform outlier correction), the corrected data is copied to the `project_folder/csv/outlier_corrected_location` `and project_folder/csv/outlier_corrected_movement_location` directories of your SimBA project with the additional corrected headers appended. If you want the transposed data, you can look in those folder as SimBA performs the transpose during import.\r\n\r\n4. Yes you can use [THIS](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/misc/BtWGaNP_meta.csv) hyper parameter meta file to create models to start. However, you may have to play with it, in particular the under sampling ratios, to get a model that performs best in your setup.",

It may be that a body-part can't move N x the length of the animal in a single frame, or that a body-part can't be located distance N x the length of the animal from all the other body-parts of the animal. If it fails those rules, the body-parts are placed in their most recent reliable location. If you have very good pose-estimation tracking, you shouln't have to apply these rules though. \r\n\r\n3) I've reached out for some help to answer this one I think @goodwinnastacia can help",

I was then able to use the .sav files after deleting the following features, the .sav files only recognize 490 features, not 498 features. I also had to add a prefix for the pose estimation locations (ex. \"**track_1**_Ear_left_1_x\")\r\n![image](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/assets/169295221/ed6ea175-b88e-414e-8c99-2665b27a7e68)\r\n\r\nHowever, after running the machine model and generating the GANTT graphs and video, I found that the classifiers were too sensitive for some, and not sensitive enough for others. I've tried multiple discrimination thresholds, so far 0.1 is too low and quantifies behavior when it doesn't happen, and 0.7 is too high and doesn't quantify anything. My pose estimation tracking is pretty good, so I'm not exactly sure what the issue is, but thank you for the resource I will follow up with them.

Or if I'm using the sav. classifiers should I use pseudo-labelling and/or advanced labeling?\r\n\r\nHi, I would always start by labeling a few full videos using the label behavior method just so that you have a good representation of what tail rattle ISN'T, since you have to teach the algorithm both what positive and negative frames look like. I would then create short clips with tail rattle present and label those with the label behavior method. Once you've got some videos labeled this way, you can take a look at using pseudolabeling. \r\n\r\nFor the tail rattle classifier we have  posted, our tracking wasn't good enough for good behavioral classification because we only did tail base and tail end. Your tracking should be better!",

I think this is advantageous because the extra tail point is going to help with your tail rattle classifications. 2) Download our targets inserted files off of OSF, add them to your project folder -> csvs -> targets inserted folder, and download the video info for those projects and add them to your own video info log. This will use our original DLC tracking for our videos with the less than ideal tail end tracking and could potentially make your classifications a bit worse at first. The advantages of this option are that you're diversifying your tracking so your models should ultimately be more robust, and you don't have to run more videos through pose estimation. Let me know which you'd like to move forward with and I can help you out with it. \r\n\r\nIt does look like there's a glitch on OSF right now and our files aren't showing up, but I should have that fixed by the end of the weekend.

                "body": "Thanks for sharing!  First, about the “support” numbers and its consistency despite different under sampling ratios:\r\n\r\nWhen you train a model, SimBA splits the data into training and testing sets, using your specified Train-Test split ratio (e.g. 80 vs 20%). It then under samples the data in the training set, retaining he same number of sniffing events and non-sniffing events in the training set **(if under sample ratio is set to 1.0)**. However, SimBA does not touch the test set: it will be 20% of your dataset pre-under sampling. We don’t want to bias the test sample, so therefore it remains untouched. \r\n\r\nAbout the fluctuations: When you sample frames using BOUTS, it ensures that the frames from the same “sniffing” event/bout don’t end up both in the training and testing set. One thing that comes to mind that even if there are a lot of non-sniffing and sniffing frames, they could be relatively long events and relatively few bouts. When training the model, a few non-sniffing bouts may be selected for training, and as there are relatively few, and they vary, you get this fluctuations between runs depending on the random selections.\r\n\r\nDo you know how many bouts of sniffing and non-sniffing you have? How does it look when you select by frames rather than bouts?\r\n\r\nAlthough the third truth table looks promising, the others seem the other primarily issues in precision over recall. That means it is over-predicting sniff events, and we may want to show the model more non-sniffing events to make it more balanced and let the model learn better what a non-sniffing event/frames look like - how does it look if you say set the under sample ratio to 2, 5 and 10?

The following 3 reports are for ratio of 2, 2.25 and 2.5 respectively.\r\n![image](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/assets/110661816/d1c6e377-1142-4ad1-8d59-cd01683b0667)\r\n![image](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/assets/110661816/56c77e44-0004-450d-a744-05480f67301e)\r\n![image](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/assets/110661816/6c75de72-c530-494b-bcd5-52f5b3034c5e)\r\nAnd the experiment on my dataset shows that the performance of ratio around 1 could sometimes give the most balanced model still though it sometimes still gives imbalanced results.\r\nI'm continuing experiments and I'll let you know if anything solves this issue.\r\n",

Yes nearly there now.. :) Fastest way to solve it, if possible, is to share a little bit of the project, enough for me to replicate the error, so I can see how this has happened, and fix it, and I can make sure no-one else bumps into it? Perhaps on a gdrive or similar?\r\n\r\nExactly as you say, SimBA loops through the body-parts it expects in the project to place a little circle on each frame and each body-part, the first body-part it expects is the left ear for Animal 1. But in year case, it's not there, and it fails. If you are using one of the standard built-in default body-part configurations, SimBa should make sure that you have a body-part called left ear, so not sure how this would come about.\r\n\r\nOne possible way that comes to me as I am typing: when you select a features file to run the validation on, are you selecting a file in the `project_folder/csv/features_extracted` directory or are you selecting a different file?\r\n\r\nSimon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Also btw why is there Ear_left_x, Ear_left_y and Ear_left_p in my files**\r\n\r\nWhen you choose one of the default body-part configurations in SimBA, then SimBA will use hard-coded names for each one of your body-part, like \"Ear_left\" instead of your name \"left_ear\". The reason for this is to standardize the naming and make all the functions downstream know, that if you want to compute anything using the left ear, then look in the \"Ear_left\" column, regardless if users named them \"my_LEFT_eAr\" or \"head_left_Side\", it will be forced to \"Ear_left\".",

However, the expected CSV had changed, into other names. So there was a mismatch in the expected and actual column names, causing the issue. \r\n\r\nTo fix it, replace the `project_folder/logs/measures/pose_configs/bp_names/project_bp_names.csv` in your project with the below file (just unzip it first). And rerun your validation.

Because of these checks currently… it’s still not very quick, especially when using mosaic concatenations that involve both vertical and horizontal joins:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"442\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/assets/34761092/a63ecb34-7272-4c38-8a70-abab2a8646f9\">\r\n\r\nJust aheads up, I can see how it is useful to create showcase videos, but if it is taking too long, it might be worth it to just play the videos separately side by side… took me 5-10min to create a vertical join of your videos\r\n\r\nTo create distance plots, like line plots representing animal distances, it’s typical to use matplotlib. To plot distances between animals for each frame of the video though, we need to create several 1000s of plots and we should split the images and process them in parallel on each available core so we don’t have to wait forever. However, matplotlib doesn’t always play nice multiprocessing, especially on Mac computers, so I needed to dig a little for alternative.",

If you have annotated `Resistance` behavior only in the left side of the tube, and you train the model including your body-part locations, then the model might pick up on that and use that correlation between your body-part location and annotations, and conclude that _Resistance is a behavior that only can happen on the left side._ Next, when you have new videos, and restistance happens in the middle of tube, then the model won't score it correctly because it thinks that resistance only happens on the left. \r\n\r\nIf your behavior **do** have spatial associations. E.g., it is a fact that `Resistance` only can happen on the left side (if it happens elsewhere it is not `Resistance`) then I recommend drawing ROIs and using those ROIs to build features as documented [HERE](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/ROI_tutorial.md#part-3-generating-features-from-roi-data)\r\n\r\nlet me know if this makes sense!\r\n\r\nSimon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The model expects 35 features. The data contains 31 features. 🚨\r\n\r\nThe same message appears when I attempt to validate model on a single video. \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Train machine model for specific behavior \r\n2. Import new videos and CSV files from DeepLabCut\r\n3. Configure video parameters \r\n4. Skip outlier correction\r\n5. Extract features\r\n6. Run machine model \r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nAfter importing new videos and their CSVs from DeepLabCut, I fixed the video parameters, skipped outlier correction, and extracted features. For all steps, I used default settings and followed the guidelines on Github. I expect that I should be able to \"Run Machine Model\" using my newly trained behavior classifier named \"groom.\" \r\n\r\nThe machine model for \"groom\" was trained using default settings for training a single model. During model training, the output was as follows: \r\nSIMBA COMPLETE: Hyper-parameter config saved (9 saved in project_folder/configs folder).  🚀\r\nReading in 14 annotated files...\r\nDataset size: 74.592MB / 0.074592GB\r\nNumber of features in dataset: 35\r\nNumber of groom frames in dataset: 556.0 (0.22%)\r\nTraining and evaluating model...\r\nFitting shake model...\r\nSIMBA COMPLETE: Classifier groom saved in models/generated_models directory (elapsed time: 1125.2436s)  🚀\r\nSIMBA COMPLETE: Evaluation files are in models/generated_models/model_evaluations folders  🚀\r\n\r\nWhich indicates the number of features in the dataset is 35. What is the number of features referring to? Why do my new videos have only 31 features after extraction? I suspect I have misclicked something but was unable to find a solution in the documentation or on this forum. I had an earlier model working fine on new videos and was able to get summaries of grooming behavior in each video, but worry I have changed something by mistake. \r\n\r\nThank you very much in advance for any insights and help!

If you search the SimBA GitHub issues or the SimBA gitter channel for keyword e.g., “mismatch” - you will find discussions on this issue here and there. \r\n\r\nI’ll describe what is happening: \r\n\r\nWhen you trained the grooming model, SimBA grabbed all the CSV files inside the `project_folder/csv/targets_inserted` directory. Each of these files contain three “types” of columns: the first columns will be your body-part locations with x,y, and p-values. The very last columns will be your hand annotations, e.g., `groom` columns with zeros and ones. Everything column in between is your “features”: they are values representing the movement of your animals. SimBA will use these in-between columns to build your machine learning model. \r\n\r\nBefore training your groom model, SimBA looks at the body-part names of your project, and the names of your classifiers in your project, and removes these columns so we only have features left. If you look inside the `project_folder/csv/targets_inserted` directory and open one of the CSV files, you should see 35 of these in-between columns. \r\n\r\nNext, now you have new video files that you want to run the classifier on. These files are located in the `project_folder/csv/features_extracted` directory. SimBA opens the each one of these CSV files, beginning with `animal54_09_02_24_res60fps.csv` and removes the body-part columns and keeps the feature columns (we don't have any annotations to remove this time). It also opens the classifier that you previously trained. Before doing anything, SimBA checks that you have the same number of columns left in the `animal54_09_02_24_res60fps.csv` that you had for the videos that you built the classifier on, and at this time it complains - you do not, you only have 31 columns, and the classifier expects 35! You have 4 fewer columns that SimBA doesn’t know what to do with that. \r\n\r\nSo where did these 4 extra columns come from and what are there? Did the  `project_folder/csv/targets_inserted` files contain any extra annotations columns (additional behaviors) that you failed to declare where annotations? Did any body-parts get added/removed to your project  between training and the new videos? \r\n\r\nYou can always share one file each from `project_folder/csv/targets_inserted` and `project_folder/csv/features_extracted`  and I can take a look and help with the digging.",

SimBA scores the center-point as entering and leaving `Arm A` a few times in quick succession, while if you score this same sequence manually, you probably would have scored it as a single entry to `Arm A` rather than several entry and exists.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/assets/34761092/3d3575a9-2962-48f6-86f4-6c6cfde38967\r\n\r\n… I don't know how commercial tools like [AnyMaze](https://www.any-maze.com/applications/y-maze/) performs the calculation, but I suspect they count that **the entire animal (excluding the tail)** have to enter the ROI (or perhaps some threshold percent of the animal body have to the enter the ROI), for an arm entry to count. \r\n\r\nOne potential solution is that we also do this, e.g., if you say 50% in a drop-down, it would count as an entry while half or more of the animal is in an arm (like the left example below), or if you say 100%, it would count as an entry only if entire animal is an arm (like the right example below). \r\n\r\n<img width=\"632\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/assets/34761092/4c419b09-4846-4e4f-81d5-692604ccca8c\">\r\n\r\n**However, I have never used AnyMaze and I have never scored spontaneous alternation, manually, what is the typical procedure and criterion for scoring an arm entry?**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Next, the animal visits C, making the sequence A->A->C. The visit to arm C, should that be counted as an error? I guess I am having a hard time getting me head around it as the animal has to visit either C or B in order to get the chance to fulfill a successful sequence in the next arm visit, but I'm guessing it should be an error. \r\n\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1wtRq-HGl0Mralik24-n2GXk4iY3Rqece/view?usp=sharing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n \r\n",

So you have any other machines to run it on, to test if this is the issue, that is not running Win 10? \r\n\r\n\r\n  ",

For this I have run the ROI analysis for both earL and earR for both animals  (black and white) and have created a file where my body-part column is the concatenation of both body parts (EarLEarR) and the detections the mean of EarLEarR. This I have saved in the logs folder. I have rof course removed the original movement and time_data csv files from the same folder.\r\n\r\nHowever, once I want to extract the ROI features and append them by animal to the already extracted features, of course I need to select the body parts that I would like to work with. And here comes my question above, will it take into account my mean_csv file that is in the logs folder or will run some part of the ROI analysis again? \r\n\r\nAnd if so, how could I manage to use the mean of the two body parts as I described?\r\n\r\nThanks so much!",

However, it finds 245 columns. It doesn’t know what to do, as the model was trained with 221 columns, and it now sees 245 columns - what should it do with all these extra columns? So it give you the error.  \r\n\r\nOne possible way that could cause a mismatch in the number of columns is, for example, you added ROI features to your new data inside the `project_folder/csv/features_extracted` directory, but you did **not** add it to the files you used to train the model with - could this be possible?",

Before training models, SimBA drops the data for your body-parts - we don't want to use the locations of the body-parts in any model. However, if the body-parts names or animal names for any reason changes across data files, then the appropriate columns will not be recognized at body-parts and SimBA will fail to drop them in some files, causing the mismatch in the column numbers errors as you see.

Not entirely sure what's going on but I can make some guesses... :)\r\n\r\nIf outlier correction is super slow: is it possible that the outlier criteria is very stringent, and the data is large? Say that using your criteria means that most or all body-part movements are classified as outliers. That would mean all body-parts  have to be corrected, which sould take significant time if the data is big? You can try increasing the criteria to see if that fixes it. \r\n\r\nFor the ``... right after 'skipping outlier correction' for another video``, could it be that you clicked to run outlier correction, and as it was so slow, you clicked `Skip outlier correction` while the outlier correction was still running? This would mean that the two processes (running outlier correction, and skipping outlier correction) would run simultaneously on two threads on your computer and you would get a messages from both these processes? \r\n\r\n",

As bodyparts for the outlier correction I used the defaults provided by Simba as suggested, but these were the two ears, thus the gross correction could be partially explained by that?\r\n\r\nI am sorry for the naivity of my questions, I am very new in this field. \r\n\r\nYour second guess is very correct, I reran everything and it all seemed normal! \r\n\r\nThanks a lot!!",

It might be, that that threshold value is too low in your case. That threshold value, from the documentation, worked well for me in my tutorial example, but it will **not** be universally true and is dictated by your animal body-parts and  quality of tracking. The model I used for the tutorial was trained with I think 3-4k annotated images, so it was very exact and maybe, looking back, not the best example to use in a tutorial... 😬 ",

I can see how this would work fine with 2 animals only, but I'm specifically interested in looking at how many bouts of behavior each animal has so I can compare behavioral interactions between Animal 1 and Animal 2 versus how Animal 2 and Animal 3 interact, for example. \r\n\r\nIs there any way I can get this information in the analysis portion of the program, or is this feature unavailable at this time?

                "body": "Hi @olivialaw - Good question. A single classifier will only provide one boolean true vs false output value (BEHAVIOR PRESENT vs BEHAVIOR ABSENT) for each frame. There is currently no way if teasing out which animal or animals performed the action if the action is e.g., \"interact\".  So, if you have three animals and you want to score specific interactions, you would need three classifiers. (Animal_1 <-> Animal_2, Animal_2 <-> Animal_3, Animal_1 <-> Animal_3). Note that if you have any type of “directionality” in your behaviors e.g., “following other animal” or “sniffing other animal” the number of required classifiers can balloon and the number of classifiers can become tricky to work with (Animal_1 -> Animal_2, Animal_2 -> Animal_1,  Animal_1 -> Animal_3, Animal_3 -> Animal_1,  Animal_2 -> Animal_3, Animal_3 -> Animal_2).. \r\n\r\nThree classifiers would be doable. The workflow I’ve come across is to annotate e.g., “interact” in BORIS, with a “ANIMAL” flag, saying which animals are performing the interact action. Then you can concatenate the animal column and the behavior column in the BORIS files into three separate behaviors as discussed in Gitter [HERE](https://matrix.to/#/!afKEsAvrtNfxHHEeIJ:gitter.im/$vMyO_w-ObWfFS2nzh7C55ODNhUkRtPxO2rnmZ8H-4ow?via=gitter.im&via=matrix.org&via=matrix.freyachat.eu). You then append that BORIS data to your data in SimBA to create three different classifiers.  ",

                "body": "Hey @charliev99! \r\n\r\nHi! Gotcha, yes, the columns you can see on the dropdowns, are boolean columns (columns that contain only 0 and 1s) that SimBA has identified in the files within the `project_folder/csv/features_extracted` directory. My guess is that inside your project, you do not have `animal_1 facing animal 2` or `animal_2 facing animal 1` columns, that’s why you can’t compute the thing that you want. So before we can compute conditional aggregate boolean statistics, we need to get the directionality data in that folder. There is a few ways to do it on top of my mind.  \r\n\r\nHow to calculate the directionality statistics between animals, is documented [HERE](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/directionality_between_animals.md). Take a look at the documentation first before reading below so what I say makes sense: \r\n\r\ni) You can check the `CREATE BOOLEAN TABLES` checkbox, which gives you a folder with CSV files in the logs directory, with one CSV file for each file file inside your `project_folder/csv/outlier_corrected_movement_location` directory. These files will contain the data you’re looking for, with each column representing the relationship between an animal and a body-part belonging to another animal, with a `1` of the body-part is within “line of sight” and `0` if it is not. \r\n\r\nii) Now, we need to get that data into the `project_folder/csv/features_extracted` directory, so that the conditional calculator can see it. You can do this in two ways. \r\n\r\nYou can check the `APPEND BOOLEAN TABLES TO FEATURES` checkbox and it will do it automatically. However, this assumes that you already have files in your `project_folder/csv/features_extracted` directory. It will also affect the number of features you have in any supervised classifier you may have, so you may not want to append it willy nilly. \r\n\r\nAnother alternative is to just check the `CREATE BOOLEAN TABLES` checkbox, then move those output files to the `project_folder/csv/features_extracted` folder (and move any other files away from that folder temporarily). \r\n\r\n(iii) Now you can run the conditional calculator and you should see the directionality data in the dropdown. \r\n\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if any of this doesn’t make sense. Also, I am thinking it may be beneficial to select the input directory in the conditional boolean menu, so you don’t have to move files around and just select the folder in the logs directory immediately. Let me know if you think this could help. ",

It would be super helpful, in terms of social behavior analysis, to know when the animals are looking at each other at the same time. For now, I understand that you only can check when animal 1 is directed towards animal 2 or vice versa, but not the combined information. Please, let me know if I am missing something and what I'm proposing might be useful and doable. Many thanks again :)\r\n",

For your scenario, it would be be a simpler input (animal_1 directs animal_2 = TRUE + animal_2 directs animal_1 = TRUE) that gives you the number of frames and time where both animal_1 directs animal_2 is true and animal_1 directs animal_2 is true.

Videos were tracked in SLEAP, and the body points are never in this location. This is still present, even with outlier correction.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. I updated SimBA with: pip install simba-uw-tf-dev --upgrade\r\n2. I set up a project, imported all videos and .h5 files from sleap (interpolation: linear; smoothing: none), set distances etc\r\n3. Tried both with and without outlier correction (location and movement set to 1.5, nose to tail base on each animal)\r\n4. analyzed directing to animals & visualized\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nI expected that the video would show body points on each mice (like when tracked in sleap) & when they are directed toward the other mouse. This was mostly the case except for long periods of time where a body point is placed in the top left corner of the video (same spot on multiple different videos - maybe the numbers are just being set to 0?) and counted in the direction data.\r\n\r\n![simba](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/assets/95374245/f95b7ace-b3a5-4501-af70-691eaf7a6945)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: windows 11\r\n - Python Version [e.g. 3.6.0]\r\n - Are you using anaconda? yes\r\n\r\n",

                "body": "Hi @ZelikowskyLab !\r\n\r\nTLDR: If you run `Body-part: Nearest` interpolation on the data, does it look better?\r\n\r\nThe 0,0 coordinate (top left corner) data is where SimBA places body-parts when the pose-estimation package doesn't provide any location for a given frame. \r\n\r\nThere are two ways to get rid of these missing data points: (i) train a better pose estimation model which provides good body parts predictions for all or nearly all frames or (ii) interpolate the missing data. \r\n\r\nThere are several interpolation methods in SimBA. They can be specified to be performed only when entire animals are missing, or when individual body-parts are missing, and can be quadratic, linear or nearest. I see that you use linear interpolation but I don't know if it is animal or body-part based. If using animal based interpolation, missing data will still be retained unless all of the bodyparts of an animal is missing. Linear interpolation is likely to be a little bit off if data is missing for extended periods of time relative to the other methods. That said, all interpolation methods will be inaccurate if data is missing for many consecutive seconds. Best method, if possible, is always to train a pose-estimation model that provides better data without missing frames so interpolation is rarely used. ",

I'm currently making path plots and I had another question about how missing points are dealt with. \r\n\r\nThe nose point in my video is sometimes not visible (certain poses where the head is down or out of frame). I skipped outlier correction as that was causing issues with tracking before. I previously used quadratic interpolation for body parts, but I've found that with some frames that puts points in the wrong location. However, when I skip these and simba puts missing points in the corner of the screen (0,0) it looks like they are tracked in the path plots? I'm not sure that's the case but it would make sense for what I'm seeing from the plot (see attached). How can I make a cleaner plot and what could this be from?\r\n![FR3_training_final_frame](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/assets/70863857/db8e6686-e7bb-4e65-8e19-8aeb4e4c31c0)\r\n\r\nAlso- I'm not sure if this is possible but it would be a cool feature if you could make path plots of a final frame without going through the machine training (I think there's an option in the main menu but it makes a whole video).

I mentioned it in an earlier issue, and there is a graph representation of the different interpolation methods [HERE](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/Interpolation_comparison.png). \r\n\r\nIn brief, say your data is [1, 2, m, m, m, m, 7, 4] where m is missing data, you might want to try a linear interpolation which would give you [1,2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 4], or a nearest interpolation which gives you [1, 2, 2, 2, 7, 7, 4]. \r\n\r\nSome other thought:\r\n\r\n1) Instead of using the nose, could you use a different body-part that is visible and is accurately tracked? \r\n\r\n2) I've seen a lot of users not label or track the nose or other body-parts in DLC or SLEAP lately, even though the experimenter knows where in the image where the nose is. The nose might be obscured by a headstage, or some bedding material, or the mouse sniffs the floor at a tilt. But if you ask the experimenter where the nose they would know with certainty where it is, but still they skip to label it. If you know where in the image the nose is, even though it is obscured, I think you should label and track that position. You can read about it in the DLC or SLEAP documentation I think thats what they also suggest. \r\n\r\n3) Also, in new future videos - make sure the animal can't be outside of the recording environment. \r\n\r\nFinally: Yes I will insert a fix - for now - if you don't have to train a model, you can manually move the CSV files from the `project_folder/csv/outlier_corrected_movement_location` folder to the `project_folder/csv/machine_results` folder and the path plot function will find them. \r\n\r\n\r\n",

One more question - when you visualize your data in DLC, how does the tracking look like (without using any filtering)? \r\n\r\nI am asking since I opened the `AGGRESSIVITY_4_11_21_Trial_2_camera1.csv` file. Looking at the first two columns (representing the X and Y coordinate of the first body-part) is largely static for the first several hundred frames, other body-parts show the same static integers for many many frames. \r\n\r\nMy guess is this: A lot of the body-part predictions are missing in your DLC data. I.e., in more than half of the frames, there is at least one and typically more body-part that your DeepLabCut model could not find (and gives it a None or NaN value). You then performed nearest interpolation in SimBA, to get body-part prediction in all frames. Although interpolation can be a solution, the interpolation will suffer when so many body-parts are missing predictions for extended time. Next, SimBA tries to calculate the mean distance between \"glave\" and \"repa\" in the video using these (predominantly) interpolated values. However, most of these are not accurate, and the outlier correction fails. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I understand what you're saying and it does make sense. I just didn't got the impression that more than half of the frames in my videos have some body part prediction missing.

This sets all body-part predictions, where the confidence are below a certain user-specified threshold, no \"None\" and hides them. If you have used it, that could explain why you have so many 'None' values that SimBA has to interpolate. I would not recommend using filtering. \r\n\r\n(ii) I have sometimes seen DLC plot either all animals in the same colors, or e.g., the left ear of one animal in the same color as the left ear of animal two. If there is an ID switch, and the left ear of animal one becomes the left ear of animal two, you won't notice because they are the same color and it masks incorrect performance of the tracking model. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

It should show, for each frame, how far the animals are from the center of each ROI. Let me know how it runs on your end. \r\n\r\n(ii) It kind of depends on the noise. The very best way (but also the most time-consuming) is to improve the tracking model, and annotate frames where the model gets the body-parts wrong.  \r\n",

I do notice the slashes are flipping out, but idk if that's normal. \r\n\r\nLet me know if there is anything I can upload for testing :D\r\nRyan\r\n\r\nPS\r\n@sronilsson, this is a symlink... idk if the labeling code and the INTERACTIVE PROBABILITY PLOT handle those differently or not...\r\n",

                "body": "@rfkova Yes, I found the error. It comes from when SimBA is trying to calculate how many colors will be needed, in how many different palettes, to draw the images. To do this it gets all the unique body-parts and divides it with  the number of animals:\r\n\r\nYou would get (rounded up for \"false\" safety) 5 / 2  = 3  colors per color palette and animal. But in your use-case this won't be enough: you have an animal with 4 body-parts and there is no 4th color in the animals pallette so it breaks. I will insert some better logic. The error is kind of badly hidden in a try and except statement also so its tricky to troubleshoot. The try and excpet statement is there because sometimes, users have a mismatch between the frames they have in the video, and the number of frames in the pose-estimation data, but they don't want it to error out, they want to see the video up until the point it errored out. And in your case it errors out on frame `0`. \r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT: Thanks for reporting this btw. It is very helpful. The code runs, I'm just going to make sure your video is created using multiptocessing and I can watch it before pushing an update. ",

I can get through my script import_h5_shuttlebox_avoidance.py (see below for code in Drive folder) which imports videos, h5 pose estimation, runs movement outlier correction (if the above is fixed, also location), and interpolation but then I get an error about symlink/video accessibility when I run smoothing... which is confusing since the prior steps all do the same to the same file.\r\n\r\nI can actually use the GUI for this project which I will switch to, but I really would like to understand why I got that error so it won't haunt me later.

One possibility is to read the FPS from the appropriate row in the `project_folder/logs/video_info.csv` file, which SimBA often does, but in some cases, like this one, we can't do that - because we are importing the video and we can't assume that Box1_06Jun2022_12-32-46 exist in the `project_folder/logs/video_info.csv` as yet. \r\n\r\nAlternative is to get the FPS from reading the meta data from the actual video file, which we make the assumption to be in the videos directory of the SimBa project, at location `project_folder\\videos\\Box1_06Jun2022_12-32-46.mp4`.

However, sometimes this file doesn't exist, or is corrupted, and then we have nowhere to turn to get the FPS, and this error comes up. \r\n\r\nJust to check, does the `R:/Basic_Sciences/Phys/Lerner_Lab_tnl2633/Ryan/Gaby_SIMBA\\shuttlebox_avoidance\\project_folder\\videos\\Box1_06Jun2022_12-32-46.mp4` file exist?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Sometime this breaks down, particularly when the video resolution is small. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately I don't have a graphical interface to control the ROI visualization text attributes, yet, as exist for the [classification visualizations](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/Scenario2.md#visualizing-classifications). However, you can go into the SimBA code and change and play around with the numbers to get it too look better in your use-case. \r\n\r\n(i) First, update simba using `pip install simba-uw-tf-dev --upgrade` to make sure you are running version 1.74.9 or later.\r\n\r\n(ii) Next, you can find out where the SimBA code lives by typing `pip show simba-uw-tf-dev`:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/assets/34761092/92eb1025-29ed-4990-a853-243992114e94)\r\n\r\n(iii) Go do that directory, and find the folder `simba` -> `utils` and open the `enums.py` in a text editor. On around line 207, you should see some numbers under `TextOptions` that SimBA uses to scale your text with some descriptions: \r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/assets/34761092/93056864-b011-4d52-a8f9-003903923fff)\r\n\r\nTo start, I recommend decreasing the RESOLUTION_SCALER value, and increasing the FONT_SCALER and see if that solves it. Then save the file, open SimBA, and run it again and let me know how it works and please let me know if you have any issues.\r\n\r\n**For the second question:**\r\n\r\nTwo days ago, I inserted an additional column in the ROI analysis in response to [this issue](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/issues/295#issuecomment-1763451878). The ROI data now contains an additional column which states which body-part you used. Let me know if that solves the problem. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

When I try to continue setting up and loading the project in SimBA, it seems to work up until the outlier correction. After trying to do that I receive the same error message as nschapp reported (SIMBA NO FILES FOUND ERROR: No datafiles found in C:/Users/User/Desktop/simba_test_v11\\test\\project_folder\\csv\\input_csv). But that is probably because of this initial traceback when importing the data?\r\n\r\nI found this thread and then also tried to import the H5 file instead, but that gives me an error about a video file that cannot be found:\r\n![image](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/assets/160256830/a9c24631-95e5-41d3-860c-8a9e107f0b16)\r\nI believe that this person had a similar issue: https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/issues/53\r\n\r\nLastly, I also tried importing the tracking data from a CSV file, and doing that, my imported video shows up and I can select the two animals in my video (they don't show any tracking points however, and I am unsure whether they're supposed to...)\r\n![image](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/assets/160256830/8b03c148-3eef-473c-bc7b-876e68a1e150)\r\n\r\nHowever, after selecting and confirming the two animals shown in the video, I receive the following error message:\r\n![image](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/assets/160256830/ac3eddb8-fe9a-4e1f-9b48-45fb4ada4a81)\r\n\r\nAs mentioned before, I think the error could perhaps also be with SLEAP (https://github.com/talmolab/sleap/issues/1681), but this thread and the one linked below from the SLEAP github seem to be the most similar to my issue.\r\n\r\nAny help/tips would be very much appreciated :) Thank you!\r\n\r\n",

After I analyze roi aggregates, extract features, and then append roi data to features, I cannot get any ROI_features_summary CSV file. I do not get any error message back, I just do not get the file. As I am using the latest version of SimBA (version 1.73.3), I would like to know if you do not get such file anymore in the latest version or if I have to run some additional steps. Please, let me know. Thanks in advance.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Draw a rectangle roi\r\n2. Analyze roi data aggregates\r\n3. append roi data to features (once extracted)\r\n4. no error, but no ROI summary csv file generated \r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nI would expect to get a ROI_features_summary_####.csv file as mentioned in https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/ROI_tutorial.md#part-3-generating-features-from-roi-data\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nn/a.\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: Windows 11\r\n - Python Version 3.6\r\n - Are you using anaconda? yes, I created a virtual env\r\n \r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI would like to use the info from the ROI summary csv file especially for ROI directionality analysis (I used similar bp labelling that include nose, left ear, and right ear tracking as specified by you), in particular the sum of time (in seconds) that each animal spent directed towards the ROI in my video\r\n",

You can use it as a config file in the SimBA interface to load the settings, in cases where you want to create a new model with the same or similar settings here:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1002\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/assets/34761092/c45a2c65-692c-4711-a69e-726fc34a9ffe\">\r\n\r\n\r\nThe `feature_importance_bar_graph` and `feature_importance_log csv file` stores a list the most important features, and the importance of all features, within your classifier. For example, if you where classifying running, you'd expect features that measures movement and velocity to be shown at the top. These two files get created when you have these checkboxes ticked when you create your model:\r\n\r\n\r\n<img width=\"593\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/assets/34761092/3e8acfb5-3bf2-438e-bd67-32de3f5b5e82\">\r\n\r\n\r\nThey don't give you the accuracy of the model, you can think of it has information on how the model works and reaches it conclusions and sanity check.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can read more about these settings in the documentation [HERE](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/Scenario1.md#train-predictive-classifiers-settings).  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I don't know enough about the behaviors and tracking data, but there is nothing, theoretically, stopping you if you're tracking is solid and behavior is salient (e.g. human can tell the behaviours apart).\r\n\r\nWe've done a few fish projects lately, albeit single fish, and some general points:\r\n\r\nOut-of-the-box default SimBA calculates mainly variables related to movements, shapes and distances between animals and their body-parts to build the classifiers. So, out-of-the-box, you will easily be able to capture behaviors like “jolts”, while some other behaviors may be trickier with the default variables. For more complex fish behaviors we’ve had to concentrate further on circular statistics, documented [HERE](https://simba-uw-tf-dev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/simba.mixins.html#module-simba.mixins.circular_statistics), to get good models going and use these methods as documented [HERE](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/extractFeatures.md), through the SimBA GUI. \r\n\r\nSo, it’s good to include two body parts for each animal in tracking which allows you to calculate circular statistics, e.g. head and swim bladder or whatever the equivalent is in your species as in image below (not just the perimeter of the fishes). If such body-parts are included, we can do more appropriate stats to capture what the human annotator is looking at.  The image is from the side but I worked with it from above as well.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/assets/34761092/8f53c334-ddbd-4193-91f4-bd33875e058d)\r\n\r\nA caveat is that building your own feature extraction class in SimBA, and pick-and-mixing these statistics calculators, requires some moderate python skills which probably keep many people away (I haven’t yet thought of a user-friendly way to do it graphically). If that is the case, I am happy to help to help put together and explain the code.\r\n\r\nLastly, we do not have domain knowledge about fish behavior, and the [calculators](https://simba-uw-tf-dev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/simba.mixins.html#module-simba.mixins.circular_statistics) have been written under guidance from people with such knowledge telling us what they need. If you find something missing, that you want calculated, let us know. \r\n\r\nThanks! \r\n\r\nSimon ",

But the pose estimation input data need to be created in some dedicated tool like DLC, it can’t currently be done within SimBA. \r\n\r\nI can see how this may be issues with your data - you have a lot of it - and you may run out of space and time as the number of videos grows and you want to do this at scale. Some notes below how to get around this!  I have zero  experience with these kinds of fish. But for what it is worth anyway, \r\n\r\nThe resolution and FPS are high. I see 59 images a second at more than 2x1.5k pixels. You can probably decrease both fps and resolution substantially, at least for for these behaviors - as long a you can see behavior by eye. E.g., if you can see the behaviors you are interested in at 25 fps by eye, then the DLC processing time will be more than halved, decrease resolution will also help.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso I noticed glare:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"423\" alt=\"Pasted Graphic\" src=\"https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/assets/34761092/00ca2ef8-d7e2-4e57-a1cd-f552881f5e23\">\r\n\r\nYou can probably get rid of some through cropping out the sides or positioning camera so sides of tank are more obscured. Another, last case option is to train the pose-estimation model what glare is and for it to ignore it.\r\n\r\nCombined with the glare and sometime not, there seems to be some identity switches? It would be good to minimize these by improving pose model in DLC\r\n\r\n<img width=\"380\" alt=\"Pasted Graphic 1\" src=\"https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/assets/34761092/e842795d-be55-4385-82df-9063d1e69c9c\">\r\n\r\n\r\nI see a lot of missing body-parts. For LB_el, each body-part don’t have any tracking data in about half the frames (around 20K ish frames), probably caused by the animals swim in Z direction. I interpolated all these missing data using “Body-part: Nearest” option in SimBA during import. Meaning, if the animal is swimming in exclusively in Z direction, SimBA will think it is standing still instead of missing. Not ideal but will work, could probably be limited by a less depth in tank but not sure if that is viable. \r\n\r\n\r\nThere are 8 body-parts tracked per animal. I don’t know all the behaviors you may want to score, but probably don’t need that many, at least for the behaviors in the example project, at least  locations could potentially be inferred post-hoc (e.g., body-part A is always [half-way in-between](https://simba-uw-tf-dev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/simba.mixins.html#simba.mixins.feature_extraction_mixin.FeatureExtractionMixin.find_midpoints) body-part B and C etc). Generally it’s most important to track outer boundaries of animals. Also for example, the movements of body-parts can be collinear, e.g., the animal can’t move one without moving the other, if you have the movement information of one body-part you have it of the other, worth thinking of when you choose with body-parts to track. \r\n\r\nThere are sections in the beginning of video, human is in the frame noting the trial start etc. I’d clip that off before doing pose-estimation, we don’t want the models to try and use that when training a model.  Ultimately, your behavior classifier will only be as good as the data going in, so it’s worth making sure the tracking is as good as it can be and process the data as quickly as possible. \r\n\r\n",

SimBA uses the names of the videos to get them accurately paired with the respective data files. \r\n\r\nLet's say I decide to draw ROIs for video named 10LfamDLC_resent_50_2023_JCRMSPRINT_2000labelled.mp4 and click draw here first:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"773\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/assets/34761092/ab34eee1-fde6-40fe-82f9-18dfa0c1a26e\">\r\n\r\nAfter drawing, SimBA then saves all your drawing information for this video under the name \"10LfamDLC_resent_50_2023_JCRMSPRINT_2000labelled\" inside the `project_folder/logs/measures/ROI_definitions.h5` of your project. \r\n\r\nNext, you go on to click on `Analyze ROI Data: Aggregates`. SimBA loops over each CSV file you have in the `project_folder/csv/outlier_corrected_movement_location`. Let's say the first file is `10Lfam.csv`. SimBA then looks inside the `ROI_definitions.h5`, for what kind of ROIs you have associated with `10Lfam`. In this case there will be no ROIs, because the ROIs you drew are saved under the name `10LfamDLC_resent_50_2023_JCRMSPRINT_2000labelled`. If this is the case for all videos, you end up with an empty CSV. \r\n\r\nLet me know if this if this could be the reason!\r\n\r\n",

I tried importing as a .slp file and a H5 file I had. Neither worked and I get the following message. The video and predictions from sleap match, and I put both of these into a new file that just has what I want to import into simba. Any ideas what is wrong? Also why use a .slp file vs H5? I see in the sleap tutorial they say to export predictions as a H5.",

You should be good! \r\n\r\nNOTE: The body-parts you track will depend on the types of behaviors that you are interested in, if you can see yourself wanting to score tail rattles the tail-tip would be a good body-part to know the location of, but if you’re scoring freezing the tail tip location may be abundant. If you don’t know exactly what behaviors you are interested in, you can do a “brute force” approach track many body-parts that allow all the behaviors you could possibly foresee being classified. Tracking many body-parts come with costs though: some body-parts may be more difficult to track than others, resulting in a lot of missing values for frames where the body-part can’t be found in pose-estimation, or ID switches between animals. This can cause issues when SimBA for example tries to calculate sizes of the animals, animal mean or aggregate speed and movements etc. SimBA can interpolate these missing body-parts, but it will suffer if there are a lot of them for long periods. Another drawback is the run-times and disk space, if you have a lot of videos and there are a lot of body-parts it will take longer to analyze  your data files will start to take up a lot of space when you can get away with less time and less taken up disk space. General rule, track the body-parts that you need to know the locations and ultimately movements, and velocities etc. of when you are scoring the behaviors manually.",

I know the video FPS is used throughout Simba so I would understand if that causes a lot of issues everywhere else.\r\n\r\nJust wondering if not using the `int` transformation would be reasonable.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n```python\r\n>>> import cv2\r\n>>> cap = cv2.VideoCapture(video_path)\r\n>>> cap\r\n<VideoCapture 00000215858DA470>\r\n>>> cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FPS)\r\n29.97002997002997\r\n>>> int(cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FPS))\r\n29\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe exact FPS could be used instead of its `int`\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: Win10\r\n - Python Version [e.g. 3.6.0]: Python 3.6.13 |Anaconda, Inc.| (default, Mar 16 2021, 11:37:27) [MSC v.1916 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32\r\n - Are you using anaconda? yes\r\n - Simba version: 1.71.6\r\n \r\n",

If this is changed, also [THIS](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/97542ecc3e7f21f6698fe0ad8cc4f9167c53dc1a/simba/video_processors/batch_process_menus.py#L366C15-L366C52) should be changed to DoubleVar(), or (StringVar in tkinter), and there is an integer unit check for fps [HERE](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/97542ecc3e7f21f6698fe0ad8cc4f9167c53dc1a/simba/video_processors/batch_process_menus.py#L585) that has to be changed to a float check rather than integer check. \r\n\r\nThe trouble is if changing `get_video_meta_data` will cause other issues elsewhere**if** ints are indeed needed where opencv is called, I don’t have enough test cases to comfortably make this change. One potential solution: We could do this below, and pass `fps_as_int = True` in batch preprocess?

My worry about the detection of FPS and the Simba pipeline as a whole still applies, though, so I would still be interested in your feedback on that point.\r\n\r\n**With regards to the batch processing of videos**\r\nI couldn't reproduce my bug on my laptop, where I do **not** have a GPU... The detection of fps by OpenCV is moot there (besides the display of FPS in the dialog window but that's minor, I think) as everything is handled by `ffmpeg` which correctly detects FPS as float. The problem I was having relates to the different commands generated depending on the `GPU` flag:\r\n- GPU is True: `ffmpeg ... -to time_difference ...`\r\n- GPU is False: `ffmpeg ... -t time_difference ...`\r\n\r\nBased on ffmpeg docs, I would say this should ALWAYS be `-t` as Simba computes and uses a time difference there and not a position.\r\nOr we can simply not calculate the time difference if it's not needed and just go with `-to` and use `end_time` straight from the yser input.

As in the below image, you see you won't get those big jumps, but smoother lines filling in the missing points.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"423\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/assets/34761092/aceb34fc-e5b2-40ec-8107-5ea80a9ec239\">\r\n\r\n(ii) If you want to try custom outlier correction, you can, but I have not been able to put these functions in the GUI so all I can offer are jupyter notebbook examples. \r\n\r\n[This notebook](https://simba-uw-tf-dev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nb/outlier_correction.html) allows you to perform outlier correction individually: first it runs movement outlier correction then location outlier correction. You just have to comment out the outlier correction that you don't want to perform in this cell:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"973\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/assets/34761092/3d1e90d1-59d9-4a0c-95f0-b6e37fd6616d\">\r\n\r\nIf you want to perform more advanced outlier correction, i.e., apply different rules to different body-part or animals, and again have option to skip different outlier correction steps, there is [THIS](https://simba-uw-tf-dev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nb/advanced_outlier_correction.html) notebook example. \r\n\r\nI wrote these notebooks recently in response to [THIS](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/issues/274) issue, you can check it to get some background. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The code is meant for creating path plots without having to import data into SimBA projects and the function is not parallelized. If you want more control over how path plots are created, and speed up the creation of the path plots **significantly**, import the data into SimBA and use this function as documented [HERE](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/Scenario2.md#visualizing-path-plots).

Although I typed up the tutorial, and written the code, I have been a little hesitant starting  to support it widely because (ii) the likely extra time commitment and (ii) the additional dependencies required that would fall on all simba users, even if they are not interested in unsupervised learning. So I have commented it out for now. I can give you some hints to get it running: \r\n\r\nTo **just** find the unsupervised code, try `pip show simba-uw-tf-dev` in your conda enviroment, it should show you where the simba package is located: \r\n\r\n<img width=\"829\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/assets/34761092/31e1df69-d4d0-49c4-8682-43c11bd046ae\">\r\n\r\nYou should find a sub-directory called `unsupervised` in that folder that has most of the code. Some unsupervised functions are within the `mixins.unsupervised.py`  file. \r\n\r\n\r\nTo activate the buttons and get it running in the GUI, uncomment this line from SimBA.py line 132:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"829\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/assets/34761092/5569f993-3cf5-4035-9455-ff18d06ff724\">\r\n\r\n\r\nThen uncomment the unsupervised button definition line 443 in SimBA.py:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"829\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/assets/34761092/14ccc700-8151-48a5-85f1-669157a1f448\">\r\n\r\n\r\nLastly, uncomment the line that inserts the unsupervised button in the GUI line 558 in SimBA.py:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"829\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/assets/34761092/97e68875-f9f9-4b77-8189-a4c3d4a2b1ee\">\r\n\r\nFinally, you must have HDBSCAN and UMAP installed in your conda environment. Ideally from the rapids library, but `pip install umap hdbscan` will also work. \r\n\r\nYou should be good to go! Let me know how it goes!\r\n\r\nSimon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

It might be true, but seems unlikely and not the first to come to mind .\r\n\r\nI had a look at the sleap created gif, the color never switches between animals, but there are a fair few missing data points and tracking oddities e.g. so I'm thinking that could be related somehow. \r\n\r\n<img width=\"764\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/assets/34761092/d8d9dc13-14b1-4a22-a141-9ed9a6db8794\">\r\n\r\nDoes sleap allow coloring all body-parts belonging to  animal in a separate palette,  rather than a uniform color per animal? \r\n\r\nIf you use [THIS](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/Tutorial_tools.md#visualize-pose-estimation-in-folder) tool to visualize the data in the `project_folder/csv/input_csv` directory after importing the data without smoothing and interpolation, do you still see the ID switches?

To get the two differently shaped models into SimBA, my plan has been to put both the dam and nest skeletons in as one, joined, skeleton. However, SLEAP, which I'm using for pose estimation, makes better predictions with separate models for the dam and the nest. So now I have two models and I need to combine them prior to feature extraction in SimBA. \r\n\r\nI can combine the pose estimations/prediction/skeletons fresh from SLEAP with a python script I have but: Occasionally, there are frames from the dam or nest predictions file without labels, or missing points... I think the outlier and interpolation steps of the SimBA import process might be best applied to the models individually, before being merged.\r\n\r\nDo you have any suggestions that might be helpful? How involved would combining skeletons (with a single connecting edge) after SimBA import be and could you point me to any helpful functions that may already exist to that end? Alternatively, if applying the pre-processing in SimBA, exporting to SLEAP and applying the script I already have seems easier (doubtful), are there any insights you might offer a priori?\r\n\r\n### I'd like to do pretty much everything in SimBA-relataed, other than labeling behavior, with CLI\r\nI'm no expert in the inner workings of SimBA (yet!). Are there any examples of CLI application of the SimBA workflow? I've been poking around and have found plenty of encouraging bits and bobs, but have not located a definitive workflow. Apologies if this is obtuse. A general 'take' on how to best approach this would be a delight. Some of these steps are pretty resource intensive and I'd rather use my University's compute cluster to free up the machines I have local access to for other things. \r\n\r\nThank you so much for sharing any insights or assistance!\r\nRyan\r\n\r\n\r\n",

How well interpolation and outlier correction works depends on the number of missing values, but I’ve seen pretty good results lately with a fair bit missing… \r\n\r\nI don’t know how the H5 file looks like if you combined two outputs, and if SimBA will accept it. If tricky there is the option to convert the files to CSVs, join the two CSVs, and import that into SimBA. There is a notebook to convert h5 to CSV [HERE]( https://github.com/talmolab/sleap/discussions/1089).\r\n\r\nI don’t know how static the nest is (if it moves a lot within-recordings this won’t work), but if not, there is also the option of manually defining a \"nest\" polygon as a [ROI]( https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/ROI_tutorial.md#part-3-generating-features-from-roi-data) and let SimBA calculate the location of the animals relative to the nest like [HERE](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-05641-w).. \r\n\r\nAbout the cluster, most demanding SimBA methods runs using multiprocessing, so speed scales with core count. There are really no GPU dependencies, beyond simpler [video pre-processing tools](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/gpu_vs_cpu_video_processing_runtimes.md) should you need it.",

I may be back with more specific questions, but let me reach a higher plane of understanding so my questions are more meaningful and direct to respect your time. \r\n\r\n> I don’t complete understand this one – is the dam network connected to the nest network?\r\n> About the pose models: If I understand right, you have two SLEAP .SLP or .H5 files output files for each video (?), one from each model, and you have a method to combine them into a single H5?\r\n\r\nYour understanding is correct! I was under the impression that multiple animals/objects (with different skeletons) had to be combined to one skeleton for SimBA import... **if I merge the dam and nest skeletons to get a single H5 file containing both skeletons and import to SimBA, you are saying I could specify two different skeletons for each \"animal\" (in this case dam and nest)?** Adding a connection between the skeletons is optional, my script for combining them adds a connection because I thought that would be necessary for SimBA, but if it is better to leave them separated so they can be treated as separate objects, that is very easy at this point. \r\n\r\nThank you again! I'm always humbled by developers' willingness to communicate so freely about their projects. It is a staggering amount of work and keeping up with requests for help can't be easy.

                "body": "@rfkova yes there is no need for all individuals to share the same body-part configuration. \r\n\r\nThe one issue I can see popping up, is that SimBA by default, using this workflow, will treat your nest as an \"animal\" when creating classifiers. This would mean that the code would compute the velocity and movement and size etc of the nest, and use those values as features for classifications could give wonky results. \r\n\r\nI can think of two ways to get around this. Either as I mentioned before, define the nest ROIs manually, then SimBA treats it as a static region, and will just compute if animals are inside nest, the distance from the animal to the nest, and the how animal is angled relative to nest. I’ve seen this being used for classifying behaviors ion relation to running wheels, and pup retrieval like in the paper linked above. \r\nOther option is to use your own or a [custom feature extractor script](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/extractFeatures.md). I have seen this being used with dams and pups, to pick and mix [feature methods available](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/simba/mixins/feature_extraction_mixin.py) to get more  accurate classifications of nursing etc, and also with fish to compute features focussed on rotation and angles specifically relevant for [non-shape shifting animals](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/simba/feature_extractors/misc/fish_feature_extractor_2023_version_5.py).

It appears that when labeling and pseudo labeling that annotations are being saved into targets inserted and when parsing through video frames from the labeled videos, the log states that the labeled behaviors are present. However, in the labeling GUI (both in continuing an existing annotation and the correct labeling after pseudo labeling), the boxes denoting the behaviors are not checked despite behaviors existing in the given frames (both as per the log and targets inserted). I have already verified that the behaviors are labeled and exist in the targets inserted directory, and this is confirmed by the statements within the log. I have also recently updated to the latest version of SIMBA and this has not resolved the issue. \r\n\r\nI would appreciate any assistance in solving the issue.

However, I am wondering if the model will learn individually based on each fly's behavior, or if it will simply learn the whole frame. For example, if some flies are grooming, some are touching, and some are chasing, will the model be able to differentiate between which fly is doing which behavior?\r\n\r\nThe only option during labeling annotations is to select the frame and select the classifier. Will this work in my case, where there are 9 to 10 animals in each frame and each animal is behaving differently?\r\n\r\nThank you for your help!",

                "body": "Hi @sahilsingh2402 !\r\n\r\nI should make this clearer in the docs; SimBA labelling GUI does not handle this use well with more than 2 animals and classifier directionalities (animal 1 chasing animal 3 vs. animal 2 chasing animal 5 etc…) and also when there are many animals and classifications should be assigned to an individual (animal 1 grooming vs animal 2 grooming etc…). The number of classification permutations quickly blows up. I don’t have a solution inside SimBA sorry, but can tell you about how I’ve solved this in the past...\r\n\r\nFor classifiers that only involve a single animal (e.g. grooming), then I've (i) filtered the pose-estimation data to only contain a single animal, (ii) annotate that data for when the animal is grooming, (iii) featurize the data and create a classifier. Then when scoring, loop over the data for each individual animal (so only data for a single animal is looked at in any one iteration) and run inference and you get as many classification vectors as there are animals… `Animal_1_grooming`, `Animal_2_grooming` etc….\r\n\r\nFor classifiers that involve 2 animals (e.g. chasing) it’s the same logic, (i) filter the pose-estimation to only contain two animals, (ii) annotate only when eg. Animal 1 chases Animal 2 (**not** when animal 2 chases animal 1), and ((iii) featurize the data and create a classifier. Then when scoring, loop over all possible permutations of two-animal data (Animal 1 and Animal 2, Animal 2 and Animal 1 etc…) when running inference to get as many classification vectors as there are 2-way permutations (`Animal_1_chases_Animal_2`, `Animal_2_chases_Animal_1`…). This won’t work when animals are very different to one another though (it won’t work if one fly is very different in behavior and size etc from another fly).  \r\n\r\nAnd watch out, because with a single classifier, and 10 animals, there would be 90 (I think?) different 2-animal chasing scores.",

BORIS has a setting for specifying which subjects are performing the annotated behaviors (which SimBA doesn't have). Those subject names can then concatenated with the behavior names and imported into SimBA as separate classifiers. E.g., in BORIS you can annotate an instance of \"animal1\" and \"animal2\"  performing \"chasing\", and in SimBA that is interpreted as an instance of \"animal1_animal2_chasing\" classifier annotation, I recently discussed this with somebody on gitter[HERE](https://matrix.to/#/!afKEsAvrtNfxHHEeIJ:gitter.im/$vMyO_w-ObWfFS2nzh7C55ODNhUkRtPxO2rnmZ8H-4ow?via=gitter.im&via=matrix.org&via=matrix.freyachat.eu) and realised this could be relevant for you.",

I'm uncertain as to when exactly the format changed, but exporting the list of events as a tabular file in BORIS now yields a nice data frame without having to skip lines:\r\n\r\n|Observation id|Observation date   |Description|Observation duration|Observation type|Source                              |Media duration (s)|FPS  |Subject|Behavior |Behavioral category|Behavior type|Time   |Media file name           |Image index|Image file path|Comment|\r\n|--------------|-------------------|-----------|--------------------|----------------|------------------------------------|------------------|-----|-------|---------|-------------------|-------------|-------|--------------------------|-----------|---------------|-------|\r\n|testobs_new   |2023-05-09 17:15:54|           |238.739             |Media file(s)   |player #&#x2060;1:videos/testExp/Video11.mp4|315.7             |59.94|       |behavior1|                   |START        |5.355  |videos/testExp/Video11.mp4|NA         |NA             |       |\r\n|testobs_new   |2023-05-09 17:15:54|           |238.739             |Media file(s)   |player #&#x2060;1:videos/testExp/Video11.mp4|315.7             |59.94|       |behavior1|                   |STOP         |9.626  |videos/testExp/Video11.mp4|NA         |NA             |       |\r\n|testobs_new   |2023-05-09 17:15:54|           |238.739             |Media file(s)   |player #&#x2060;1:videos/testExp/Video11.mp4|315.7             |59.94|       |behavior2|                   |START        |11.178 |videos/testExp/Video11.mp4|NA         |NA             |       |\r\n|testobs_new   |2023-05-09 17:15:54|           |238.739             |Media file(s)   |player #&#x2060;1:videos/testExp/Video11.mp4|315.7             |59.94|       |behavior2|                   |STOP         |11.728 |videos/testExp/Video11.mp4|NA         |NA             |       |\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this means SimBA cannot directly import these newly-formatted files from BORIS (not without manually editing them, of course). This pull request simply enables SimBA to do just that.\r\n\r\nThis is done by adding a quick version checker seeking for the presence of a column name found only in the new format, followed by the adjustment of expected columns headers to match what SimBA is already expecting. This way, importing a BORIS annotation file that uses the now-older format should still work.\r\n\r\n@sronilsson, I have tested using both importing ways:\r\n- using the \"Import BORIS Annotation (select folder with .csv files)\" button. This does give a csv file with the behaviors appended as the last columns in `project_folder/csv/targets_inserted`. The log in the main SimBA window is:\r\n```\r\nProcessing BORIS for 1 file(s)...\r\nFound 3 annotated behaviors in 1 files with /home/florian/PycharmProjects/Simba/external_data/exports/mixed_observations directory\r\nThe following behavior annotations where detected in the boris directory:\r\nbehavior1\r\nbehavior2\r\nbehavior3\r\nAppending BORIS annotations to Video11 ...\r\nSaved BORIS annotations for video Video11...\r\nSIMBA COMPLETE: BORIS annotations appended to dataset and saved in project_folder/csv/targets_inserted directory (elapsed time: 1.1996s)\r\n```\r\n\r\n- using the (newer?) \"Append third-party annotations\" window. This also gives a csv file with the behaviors appended as the last columns in `project_folder/csv/targets_inserted`. The log in the main SimBA window is:\r\n```\r\nProcessing 1 BORIS file(s)...\r\nReading in 1 BORIS annotation files...\r\nProcessing annotations for Video11 video...\r\nSaved BORIS annotations for video Video11...\r\nSIMBA COMPLETE: BORIS annotations appended to dataset and saved in project_folder/csv/targets_inserted directory (elapsed time: 1.3718s)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have not tested using an older BORIS format file as I do not have one with matching video and pose tracking files.\r\n\r\nHope this helps,",

I am using SimBA to do automated behavioral analysis of nape scratching and previously I trained the left and right nape scratching models on 20 videos, but as a part of my research we would like to see how the model performs on new videos with nape scratching, running the same model on new videos. I noticed that the videos that I labeled behavior on and produced machine results of in the past worked but the 7 new videos output machine result files with no scratches (1s) recorded even though the DLC tracking performed well on those videos and it is clearly visible to the human eye that scratching is occurring. I tried validating the model on a previous video with a 0.70 threshold and 100ms minimum bout length and that looked like it gave good results but when I validate on a single video on one of the new added videos it still does not classify any scratches. From my understanding, you should not have to label behavior if you add new videos to the project but instead go to the Run Machine Model step after you have imported tracking data and videos, set video parameters, ran outlier correction, and extracted features on these new videos. I would like to use existing models for left and right nape scratching but it does not seen to be performing correctly. I was wondering if you had any advice on how to fix this problem and if I am missing something or if there is an error somewhere.

If you lower the discrimination threshold for the new videos, how does it look?

For each mouse, 8 bodyparts have been labeled (according to the labeling scheme that is used in SIMBA). However, since SIMBA is optimized for 2 animals, I guess the features that will be extracted and used for the model (with 4 mice) are much limited compared to the 492 features that can be used for the 2 mice. I was wondering how many features will be used if I use my videos and tracking files with 4 mice, and if it's better that I just do pairwise comparisons instead with all the possible combinations of pairs of mice, so that all features can be used.",

Yes, when using a user-defined pose-config, SimBA will by default calculate (i)  the distance between the animals body-parts and other animals body-parts, (i) the aggregated distance moved in rolling windows, (iii) aggregated distances between animals in rolling windows, and some (iv) counts of pose-probability scores scores in different buckets. It’s not a lot in terms of breadth, but it is kept limited as otherwise blows up when someone come with tons of animals / body-parts: not exactly sure how many features you’ll end up with but maybe 500-600?  **Default features will likely get you chasing, BUT the tricky part with the use-case is typically directionality: you probably want to know who is chasing who and with 4 individuals you have 12 chasing permutations and it can be too much a chore creating 12 classifiers**.

Yoou're saying that would be a problem in case I use my user-defined configuration with 4 mice, right?\r\nSo a solution would be to train on just 2 mice, and then use the videos and associate them to cropped csv files with just 2 mice at a time, which would allow me to detect with just one classifier all chases events.\r\nAt this point, is there a way to extrapolate the information on which mouse is the chaser, and which is the chased? For example, I train to recognize behaviors as chases with both instances in which mouse1 is chasing mouse2, and mouse2 is chasing mouse1. When I analyze my new videos, can I know in which instances labeled as chases mouse1 is the chaser, or mouse2 is the chaser? Or would I need to create 2 different classifiers for that?\r\n",

If you annotate frames as contains \"animal 1 chases animal 2\" it will find \"animal 1 chases animal 2\". So you would need two classifiers for two mice doing chasing. As a solution I wrote a method to  [\"reverse\" classifiers](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/reverse_annotations.md) so people would only have to annotate one directions, and then reverse the classifier. However, last I heard, a couple of users encounterd bugs with these methods in the GUI, and I have not had any time to maintain it. But just as an FYI that it's doable in case you wan't to type something up yourself. ",

There have been many improvements,\nhighlights are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Annotations of the main namespace are essentially complete. Upstream\nis a moving target, so there will likely be further improvements,\nbut the major work is done. This is probably the most user visible\nenhancement in this release.</li>\n<li>A preliminary version of the proposed Array-API is provided. This is\na step in creating a standard collection of functions that can be\nused across application such as CuPy and JAX.</li>\n<li>NumPy now has a DLPack backend. DLPack provides a common interchange\nformat for array (tensor) data.</li>\n<li>New methods for <code>quantile</code>, <code>percentile</code>, and related functions. The\nnew methods provide a complete set of the methods commonly found in\nthe literature.</li>\n<li>A new configurable allocator for use by downstream projects.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are in addition to the ongoing work to provide SIMD support for\ncommonly used functions, improvements to F2PY, and better documentation.</p>\n<p>The Python versions supported in this release are 3.8-3.10, Python 3.7\nhas been dropped. Note that 32 bit wheels are only provided for Python\n3.8 and 3.9 on Windows, all other wheels are 64 bits on account of\nUbuntu, Fedora, and other Linux distributions dropping 32 bit support.\nAll 64 bit wheels are also linked with 64 bit integer OpenBLAS, which should fix\nthe occasional problems encountered by folks using truly huge arrays.</p>\n<h2>Expired deprecations</h2>\n<h3>Deprecated numeric style dtype strings have been removed</h3>\n<p>Using the strings <code>&quot;Bytes0&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;Datetime64&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;Str0&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;Uint32&quot;</code>,\nand <code>&quot;Uint64&quot;</code> as a dtype will now raise a <code>TypeError</code>.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/19539\">gh-19539</a>)</p>\n<h3>Expired deprecations for <code>loads</code>, <code>ndfromtxt</code>, and <code>mafromtxt</code> in npyio</h3>\n<p><code>numpy.loads</code> was deprecated in v1.15, with the recommendation that\nusers use <code>pickle.loads</code> instead. <code>ndfromtxt</code> and <code>mafromtxt</code> were both\ndeprecated in v1.17 - users should use <code>numpy.genfromtxt</code> instead with\nthe appropriate value for the <code>usemask</code> parameter.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/19615\">gh-19615</a>)</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

Yes\r\n - Simba version: 1.58.1 (fresh pip install today)\r\n \r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThis seems to result from the fact that `__check_validity_of_meta_files()` expects the meta file to have the column name `custom_weights` whereas the actual name is `class_custom_weights`. Manually changing this in `train_multiple_models.py` fixes the issue but quickly fails again with:\r\n```\r\nException in Tkinter callback\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"C:\\Users\\username\\miniconda3\\envs\\simbadev\\lib\\tkinter\\__init__.py\", line 1705, in __call__\r\n    return self.func(*args)\r\n  File \"C:\\Users\\username\\miniconda3\\envs\\simbadev\\lib\\site-packages\\simba\\SimBA.py\", line 363, in <lambda>\r\n    button_train_multimodel = Button(label_trainmachinemodel, text='TRAIN MULTIPLE MODELS (ONE FOR EACH SAVED SETTING)',fg='green',command = lambda: threading.Thread(target=self.train_multiple_models_from_meta(config_path=self.config_path)).start())\r\n  File \"C:\\Users\\username\\miniconda3\\envs\\simbadev\\lib\\site-packages\\simba\\SimBA.py\", line 593, in train_multiple_models_from_meta\r\n    model_trainer.run()\r\n  File \"C:\\Users\\username\\miniconda3\\envs\\simbadev\\lib\\site-packages\\simba\\train_mutiple_models.py\", line 148, in run\r\n    self.meta_dicts = self.__check_validity_of_meta_files(meta_file_paths=self.meta_file_lst)\r\n  File \"C:\\Users\\username\\miniconda3\\envs\\simbadev\\lib\\site-packages\\simba\\train_mutiple_models.py\", line 124, in __check_validity_of_meta_files\r\n    for k, v in meta_dict[ReadConfig.CLASS_WEIGHTS.value].items():\r\nAttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'items'\r\n```\r\nThis shows that the routine fails to deal with the dict being read as str from the file. I could fix all of that using the same approach used elsewhere in SimBa:\r\n```python\r\n                if meta_dict[ReadConfig.CLASS_WEIGHTS.value] == 'custom':\r\n                    weights = ast.literal_eval(meta_dict['class_custom_weights'])\r\n                    meta_dict[ReadConfig.CLASS_WEIGHTS.value] = weights\r\n                    for k, v in meta_dict[ReadConfig.CLASS_WEIGHTS.value].items():\r\n                        meta_dict[ReadConfig.CLASS_WEIGHTS.value][k] = int(v)\r\n```\r\nNote that it seems one could/should update `ReadConfig.CUSTOM_WEIGHTS` to be `class_custom_weights` or revert change the meta file to have `custom_weights` as column name but that is beyond my knowledge of SimBA to know which way to address this would be the most reliable and safe.\r\n",

The code is developed in 3.6 env though, and not tested in any other version. So there could be some dependency tinkering before it boots up in >3.6. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  ",

My arena contains a nest and when the mice enter in it, they disappear and that is a very important information that we don't want to loose. Considering your solution, the only way that I solve the problem is to interpolate the pose estimation data. This is a good idea but the problem is that the mice can spend a lot of time in the nest. Hence, for them not to disappear, I would have to set a very long period for the interpolation and I am afraid it is going to mess with the data when the mice are actually visible by the camera.\r\nDo you have an idea of how I could do to solve this problem?\r\nIf not, I think the best thing to do is to run the nest analysis as if it was a classical traking situation, and analyse the other data by removing the moments they are in the nest. This solution still makes me loose a lot of data.\r\nThank you in advance!",

I **thought** it was because all the body-parts landed on the same coordinate (the animal is one-dimensional), and was surprised, as we should catch 1D events now and set the animal volume to `0`. However I looked back at your error and that does not seem to be it - you seem to have sub-pixel data with body-parts landing on eg pixel 1.8e-25 and pixel 4.2e-25 and I am guessing [scipy.spatial.ConvexHull](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.ConvexHull.html) struggle with these values.

        "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nI am working to plot results using the Plotly feature in SimBA. I am following the instructions on the page titled \"Interactive Data Visualization and Export in SimBA,\" but I am only able to view results on the graph that is titled \"Probability [Behavior] - Group Means.\" I checked the boxes to load information from the Sklearn results, Time Bin analyses, and probabilities in the Plotly/Dash section of the Visualizations tab in the GUI. \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Create a new project in SimBA with three behaviors. Define a skeleton for multi-animal tracking, where each animal has 13 body parts. \r\n2. Import 2 videos, the corresponding SLEAP tracking data (do not perform any interpolation or smoothing), and then extract the frames. \r\n3. Load the project, and then set video parameters.\r\n4. Go to the Outlier Correction tab and select Skip Outlier Correctoin (I think my SLEAP tracking was accurate so I skipped this part).\r\n5. Extract features. \r\n6. Label behavior. When labeling behavior, I labeled 1 in every 100 frames for the first 20,000 frames in a 70,000 frame video. I was just testing out my videos here, so I did not label an entire video.\r\n7. Train Machine Model. Use the hyperparameters in the BtWGaNP_meta.csv file, and press Save settings to specific model. Make a model with the hyperparameters in the BtWGaNP_meta.csv file for each behavior. Then, press Train multiple models, one for each saved setting. \r\n8. Under the Run Machine Model tab, click Model Settings, and load in the appropriate .sav file for each behavior. Set a threshold and minimum bout length. Press Set Model(s). Then, press Run RF Model.\r\n9. Analyze the machine results by generating files for the following options: Analyze machine predictions, Analyze distances/velocity, Time bins: Machine predictions, and Time bins: Distance/velocity.\r\n10. Under the Visualizations tab, go under Sklearn Visualizations and the Apply to all videos subheading. Check the generate videos box and press Visualize classification results. Then, I generated a gnatt plot by going under the gnatt plot subheading and checking the create videos box before pressing Generate gnatt plot. \r\n11. Go under Plotly/Dash in the Visualizations tab and check Sklearn results, Time bin analyses, and probabilities. Then press Save SimBA/Plotly dataset. Load the H5 file and press Open SimBA/Plotly dataset.\r\n12. See error\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nI should see results for the probabilities, sklearn results, and time bin analyses when I open Plotly. \r\nThe option for selecting sklearn data is not available. \r\nWhen I select the time bins analyses option, nothing appears on either graph. \r\nWhen I select the VideoData category in Plotly, which displays the probabilities data, I only see data on the top graph and not on the bottom graph with the Mean Time (seconds) on the y-axis and Video/Group on the x-axis. \r\n**Screenshots**\r\nThe first screenshot shows what I see when I select the VideoData category for probabilities. The second screenshot shows what I see when I click on the time bins category. \r\n\r\n![Plotly Probabiilities Issue](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121840032/214157454-970c167b-fb63-47e4-b743-7e09d618e505.PNG)\r\n![Plotly TimeBins Issue](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121840032/214157469-a09a7f62-9b29-4608-acda-48e7cf67125d.PNG)\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n - Windows 10\r\n - Python 3.6.13\r\n - I am using Anaconda\r\n \r\n\r\nIf you could show how to display all of the sklearn, time bins, and probability data in Plotly, I would really appreciate it!",

The reason I didn't respond sooner is that I didn't build the dashboard and the the people that did, are not around to maintain, so not an immediate fix available for me, need to look at their code. The time bins data output was recently transposed in Simba, and the dashboard probably expects one row per video instead of one row per time bin. \r\n\r\nI'm overwhelmed at the moment, so can't get to it.

There is also a tool [HERE](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/classifier_validation.md#classifier-validation) to help understand what the classifier has trouble with.*\r\n\r\nE.g., the key to annotations is not so much quantity as quality. Is there some way if figuring out through visualizations if there is a specific form of grooming event the classifier get wrong, and adding those frames as correct annotations to the classifier? Are there shorter grooming bouts, or when the animal is angled in a specific way, that the classifier don't have many good examples of?\r\n",

If you only focus on precision, you are likely to get a lot of false negatives: i.e., you will incorrectly classify frames as not containing behavior when then in fact do contain the behavior. You’d want to have a good recall too. \r\n2. Hyper-parameters can be helpful, but the thing that helps the very most is re-sampling: I don’t know how many annotations for behavior present and behavior absent you have, but you want to titrate the balance between them that you use to train the classifiers. Have you used random under sampling as documented [here](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/Scenario1.md#step-7-train-machine-model) next to the `Under sample setting` bullet point? I recommend setting the `Under sample setting` to `random undersample` and the `under sample ratio` to `1.0` to see if that helps. ",

        "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nIn the videos generated by sklearn, the skeletons are not in the same position as the mouse. \r\n\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Open SimBA and create a new project. Under SML Settings, set the number of predictive classifiers equal to 3 and give each classifier a name. \r\n2. Select Multi Tracking under the Type of Tracking menu and create a user-defined pose config that is for two animals, each with 13 body parts. Select this user-defined pose config for the project. \r\n3. Click on Generate Pose Config and then advance to the Import videos into project folder tab.\r\n4. Fill in the path information under the Import single video section and press Import videos (I imported two videos. Each had around 74000 frames and the frame rate was 60 frames/second). Then, click on the Import tracking data tab.\r\n5. For File type select SLP (SLEAP), choose Animal(s): Linear for the interpolation and Gaussian for the smoothing. Set the period equal to 100 ms. For number of animals, put 2 and give each animal a label. \r\n6. Extract frames into the project folder.\r\n7. Next, load the project and go to the video parameters tab. Enter in a known distance and complete the appropriate steps.\r\n8. Under the Outlier Correction tab, click Settings and have body part 1 be the snout and body part 2 be the left ear for both the location and movement corrections. Set the location criterion equal to 1 under the location correction, and set the location criterion equal to 2 for the movement correction. For aggregation method, click median. (I am still learning about the parameters I set here, so if these parameters were not optimal, feel free to let me know)\r\n9. Extract Features\r\n10. For labeling behavior, I used the advanced label behavior method. since I had so many frames in each video, I only annotated once every 50 frames for the first 20000 frames in one video for this test.\r\n11. To train the machine model, I used the model parameters provided on the SimBA GitHub, and they can be found in the screenshot attached. I chose the Save settings for specific model option, and I created three models - one for each behavior. \r\n12. Under the Run Machine Model tab, I clicked on all the buttons under the Analyze Machine Results tab except for Classifications by ROI (I did not do ROI for this test)\r\n13. I then clicked on the Visualizations tab and under Sklearn Visualization section, I found the Apply to all videos subsection, where I checked the Generate video box and the button that said Visualize classification results. This was performed on both of the videos I imported. One of the videos is attached below, and the placements of the skeleton are not accurate, even though the SLEAP data on the mice was. \r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe skeletons on these mice in the sklearn videos should have been accurate. Another thing I want to point out is that when I click on the user-defined pose configuration I created that has 13 markers on each animal, a picture of the mice I labeled in the process of creating this configuration does not appear. Instead, I see the image in the screenshot below. I am not sure why this incorrect picture is appearing. I am not sure if this picture is playing a role. \r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nThe screenshots and video are attached.\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n - Windows\r\n - Python 3.6.13\r\n - I am using Anaconda\r\n \r\n\r\n![User Defined Config Picture Issue](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121840032/210939298-9e3b3731-9750-4094-9934-f4f7f02ed1ed.PNG)\r\n![Model Parameters](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121840032/210939312-aeceea13-035e-4c64-9bc3-635edda4f526.PNG)\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n",

For a full video, maybe there are one hundred of this behavior,  do i need to label all of them?  if labeling 10 of this behavior, does it can work?\r\n\r\n2) I only foucs on freezing behavior, so  in addition to freezing behavior, do i need to creat another classifier named non-freezing behavior and then label it?\r\n",

Ideally the annotations should contain examples of edge-cases and: as in \"a naive observer might have difficulties with this one\". It's difficult to say how many annotations you need, as it depends on how good your tracking is and the complexity of your behavior. There are some example annotations count in the SImBA priprent table 2: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.19.049452v2.full.pdf. \r\n\r\nIf you only annotate parts of the videos (and skip annotating some frames) - there are a few annotations methods in SimBA that differ in the way they handle those un-annotated frames - e.g., should the un-annotated frames be assumed not containing the behavior, or should we skip using them in the classifier. You can read more about it here: https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/label_behavior.md\r\n\r\n2. All classifiers are binary, so you only need one per behavior. You get a probability score ranging from 0-1 of the behavior is present in every frame. You can think of it as the same as annotating in pose-estimation tools. When you place your marker for where the body-parts are, you are also telling the models where the body-part isn't",

Is that all the info you need? Those outputs will be in string format, not numerical, and won't immediately fit into any downstream Ml algo. If for ML I guess it would have to be transformed to counts or some sparse table with categoricals.  ",

Circle or rectangle ROIs would suffice, attached is an example superimposed over a frame from the previous video. By specifying the dimensions of a rectangle, and the body part to which it is anchored, you could in theory limit it to head-to-head, or head-to-tail overlaps as needed.\r\n2. It would also be useful to have a time measure, indicating the number of frames that ROIs remain overlapped, this would then allow discrimination between chance overlaps and actual interactions, by setting a user-defined time threshold for overlaps to qualify as an interaction.\r\n3. The key outputs would be overlap IDs, a count of these to quantify the number of interactions between each ID pair, and perhaps a measure of overlap event durations and timings. As you mention, most downstream analyses would work with counts and pair overlap frequencies.\r\n\r\nI am happy to discuss in more detail if any of the above points need further clarification.\r\n\r\n![Anchored ROIs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109351104/200543633-2982f850-861a-4843-af7a-1171c00c10d3.png)\r\n",

To find the boundary boxes, the most straightforward might be if used input four key-points (anterior/posterior and the laterals) or two key-points (anterior/posterior) + some user-defines extra metric space to get the boxes.  Once done, we could do a few revisions after you're feedback and you've tried it, I can see how this could be useful for others. \r\n\r\nThe alternatives that would work for you are to extract the black blobs from the white background (e.g. cv2.findContours), or find the animal boundaries through motion (e.g., cv2.calcOpticalFlowPyrLK). You can also find the animals with object segmentation (YOLOv5 is nice). But not sure this would generalize to other setups, but in case this doesn't work out a few things to try.",

I thought it would make sense to divide my feedback into separate lists for issues and errors that I encountered, and suggestions for additions.\r\n\r\nIssues:\r\n1. I experience an error when attempting to calculate aggregate boundary statistics with the minimum bout length set to any value above 0. This returns the error message ‘TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'str' and 'float'’. If I leave the minimum bout length field empty, the process works as intended.\r\n2. This is more of a compatibility issue rather than a problem with the anchored ROIs, but SIMBA only appears to work with ‘.slp’ files, rather than the main SLEAP export format of ‘.h5’. The result is that the user has to export files from their ‘model predictions’ folder in SLEAP, rather than creating an export package as intended.\r\n3. If a video file is a frame or more longer than the tracking data, this leads to a segmentation of the output visualisations. It would be useful to return a warning that the video is longer than the tracking data in such cases (which can happen in SLEAP), as this would notify the user of the specific issue.\r\n\r\nSuggestions:\r\n1. For the aggregate statistics, it would be useful to add an option for ‘interaction time per bout’, this would then produce a case for each recorded interaction, and its corresponding time in seconds. Such a feature would effectively allow an output of the raw data at the resolution of individual interactions, and users could then aggregate or analyse it as needed.\r\n2. When only the ROIs overlap, it would be more informative to label the ‘animal 2 key point’ category as ‘ROI only’, or something similar, rather than ‘none’.\r\n3. I think you may have already touched upon this, but it would be nice to have the range of features available for the ‘ROI’ and ‘Visualizations’ tabs integrated into the anchored ROI tab. Options such as changing the ROI colours and appearance, and producing basic summary visualisations would be useful in the longer-term.\r\n\r\nI will go through the tutorial document and make any suggestions or edits that I think will help to clarify things for users. Other than that, I really appreciate you putting this together, as it is already a tractable and robust system for generating interaction data.",

I thought it was a little odd, as this wasn't a user-friendly file.

You’re right, we did originally plan for this…  but there has not been any work on this for quite some time.\r\nThe code for creating single classifiers is [here](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/a6436c223d2e5442a3b676541af3df28865cbfe2/simba/train_single_model.py#L79), there is only a `if self.algo == \"RF\"`  at the moment.  For grid searching models it’s this [method](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/a6436c223d2e5442a3b676541af3df28865cbfe2/simba/train_mutiple_models_from_meta_new.py#L74) which just implicitly assumes that the input is `RF`. Both these would have to be updated to accept other algorithms. We’d have to update the GUI user-menus in SimBA to become dynamic where the hyperparameter entry boxes change depending on bagging vs boosting etc, as well has the structures holding the different hyperparameters when users train multiple models in a grid search. That kind of held me back from writing the code, that plus that I don’t expect to see any drastic model performance improvement in our use cases when shifting from RF to xgboost.. \r\n\r\nIf you have a pickle and want to run it through SimBA, that might work as long as there is a SimBA`project_config.ini` that hold the path of classifier, as well as some parameters (threshold, minimum bout length). [This is the class SimBA uses for inference](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/simba/run_model_new.py). You see SimBA just picks the paths that are defined in the `project_config.ini`. `predict_proba` is also the name of the method in xgboost I believe, so might work out of the box but I haven’t tried it.

Once that is done, you want to use it to the `test2.6.slp` project, to analyze new videos, such as `video.mp4`, so you run your inference on on video.mp4 using the model inside the test2.6.slp project. That should produce an output file, which holds all the body-part coordinates for video.mp4. I think they name that output file `video.slp` in sleap. ",

The probabilities that the behavior is present are also very low for all frames. \r\n\r\nOne way this could happen would be if you fed a lot of annotations with behavior absent into your classifier, together with a very small number of behavior present annotations. How many annotated frames with the behavior-present vs behavior-absent did you use to create the model?\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the annotations are imbalanced towards behavior-absent, this would bias the model towards classifying most frames as behavior absent. One way around this is to balance your annotations, taking an equal or similar amount of behavior-absent and behavior-present frames when you create your classifier – check out the [Random undersampling]( https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/Scenario1.md#train-predictive-classifiers-settings) in the machine model settings for how to balance the data. \r\n",

From what I can see on the screengrabs, a video called `D1_C9A1_cropped` is annotated. \r\n\r\nWhen you click on `Train single model from global environment`, SimBA pulls all of the video files that have been annotated.

Data labelled for mouse 1 are actually related to my mouse 2 and vice versa. \r\n- The IDs are also reversed when I generate a path plot video, So the error seems constant. \r\n- When I analyze ROI only for one animal at a time, only the Movement_within_ROIs file generates indeed data for one animal, but the ROI_entry_data and ROI_time_data still present data for both animals.\r\n\r\nHow can I fix these issues?\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nBest,\r\nDorian\r\n",

I know a screen with the video playing is suppose to pop up, but instead, my terminal says: \r\nOpenCV: Couldn't read video stream from file \"/Users/lsbmorrisonlab/Documents/Simba/test/test4/project_folder/videos/0\" \r\nas soon as I click the 'set video parameters' button.

Your video, for example, is called `1014DLC.mp4`, while the imported file is called `1014.csv`. When you click on 1014DLC, there is a mismatch, and SimBA is most likely searching for `1014.mp4` and it breaks, because it doesn't exist. \r\n\r\nThat said, I would also avoid pure integer filenames if you can, as there may be some bugs loitering around from early days and I'm trying to find time and fix. E.g., Importing a video called `Video_1014` is much better than imprting a video called `1014`. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

In the most recent issue I submitted, I was having trouble getting the Feature Extraction feature to work, and I solved that issue by using the proper videos and making sure the `video_info.csv` file has the correct information. However, now that all of that is fixed, I can complete feature extraction but in the SimBA command window I am seeing this stating that no features were extracted: \r\n`Pose-estimation body part setting for feature extraction: user_defined\r\nApplying settings for classical tracking...\r\nExtracting features from 0 file(s)...\r\nSIMBA COMPLETE: Feature extraction complete for 0 video(s). Results are saved inside the project_folder/csv/features_extracted director.`\r\n\r\nAlso, in the Anaconda Prompt command window I am seeing this error message:\r\n\r\n`warning: Error opening file (/build/opencv/modules/videoio/src/cap_ffmpeg_impl.hpp:901)\r\nwarning: N:/Ross/1Tayler Sheahan/Automated Behavioral Analysis/Madeline Fontana/SimBA\\Full_SimBA\\project_folder\\videos\\0 (/build/opencv/modules/videoio/src/cap_ffmpeg_impl.hpp:902)`\r\n\r\nI was researching this error and I think it has something to do with it not being able to open a video, but could someone please help me understand what is happening here so that I can get it to work?

The first screenshot shows the end of the file, where my last video does not have values for the first three columns.

The second screenshot shows the top of the `video_info.csv` file where you can see what I am talking about. I tried to delete the ones without labels, but then ended up going back to import them back in before continuing to the video parameters, outlier correction, and now the feature extraction steps. However, the total labeled number of videos is 29, which it said it was extracting features from video 1/29 when it got stuck and this error appeared.

I put these values in the Outlier settings. I am a little confused of how this step works, did I do this properly and did I put the right numbers?

SimBA will calculate the mean (or median value) between the two body-parts (in this example, the right ear and the tail). SimBA will then use the entered multiplier to get a threshold value. For example, for the movement criterion, if the median distance between  the right ear and the tail is 100mm, and the **multiplier** is set to 2, then any body-part movement larger than 100mm*2 is treated as an outlier movement, and the movement is removed, and the body-part is placed back in the most recent reliably coordinate before the movement. There is more info on this [here](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/misc/Outlier_settings.pdf)\r\n\r\nThe error you are seeing however is unrelated to this. After correcting the outliers, SimBA will modify the heading of the file so it is standardized regardless from whi\r\n![Untitled 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34761092/177791973-735269f8-5a3c-441b-bc26-4c790520d45c.png)\r\nch pose-estimation package the data comes from. SimBA wants to insert 27 new headings, and believes that you are tracking 9 bodyparts (27 / 3). However, the file only contains 6 body-parts (18 /3).

You can also read about them here: https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/Tutorial_DLC.md\r\n\r\nYour body-parts, e.g., `hand paws`, is not available in these built-in configurations. That means we have to create and choose to use a `user-defined body-part configuration` in the SimBA dropdown menu when we create our project. There is a tutorial for how to do that here: https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/Pose_config.md Let me know if that makes sense!\r\n",

Upstream\nis a moving target, so there will likely be further improvements,\nbut the major work is done. This is probably the most user visible\nenhancement in this release.</li>\n<li>A preliminary version of the proposed Array-API is provided. This is\na step in creating a standard collection of functions that can be\nused across application such as CuPy and JAX.</li>\n<li>NumPy now has a DLPack backend. DLPack provides a common interchange\nformat for array (tensor) data.</li>\n<li>New methods for <code>quantile</code>, <code>percentile</code>, and related functions. The\nnew methods provide a complete set of the methods commonly found in\nthe literature.</li>\n<li>A new configurable allocator for use by downstream projects.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are in addition to the ongoing work to provide SIMD support for\ncommonly used functions, improvements to F2PY, and better documentation.</p>\n<p>The Python versions supported in this release are 3.8-3.10, Python 3.7\nhas been dropped.

There have been many improvements,\nhighlights are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Annotations of the main namespace are essentially complete. Upstream\nis a moving target, so there will likely be further improvements,\nbut the major work is done. This is probably the most user visible\nenhancement in this release.</li>\n<li>A preliminary version of the proposed Array-API is provided. This is\na step in creating a standard collection of functions that can be\nused across application such as CuPy and JAX.</li>\n<li>NumPy now has a DLPack backend. DLPack provides a common interchange\nformat for array (tensor) data.</li>\n<li>New methods for <code>quantile</code>, <code>percentile</code>, and related functions. The\nnew methods provide a complete set of the methods commonly found in\nthe literature.</li>\n<li>A new configurable allocator for use by downstream projects.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are in addition to the ongoing work to provide SIMD support for\ncommonly used functions, improvements to F2PY, and better documentation.</p>\n<p>The Python versions supported in this release are 3.8-3.10, Python 3.7\nhas been dropped. Note that 32 bit wheels are only provided for Python\n3.8 and 3.9 on Windows, all other wheels are 64 bits on account of\nUbuntu, Fedora, and other Linux distributions dropping 32 bit support.\nAll 64 bit wheels are also linked with 64 bit integer OpenBLAS, which should fix\nthe occasional problems encountered by folks using truly huge arrays.</p>\n<h2>Expired deprecations</h2>\n<h3>Deprecated numeric style dtype strings have been removed</h3>\n<p>Using the strings <code>&quot;Bytes0&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;Datetime64&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;Str0&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;Uint32&quot;</code>,\nand <code>&quot;Uint64&quot;</code> as a dtype will now raise a <code>TypeError</code>.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/numpy/numpy/pull/19539\">gh-19539</a>)</p>\n<h3>Expired deprecations for <code>loads</code>, <code>ndfromtxt</code>, and <code>mafromtxt</code> in npyio</h3>\n<p><code>numpy.loads</code> was deprecated in v1.15, with the recommendation that\nusers use <code>pickle.loads</code> instead. <code>ndfromtxt</code> and <code>mafromtxt</code> were both\ndeprecated in v1.17 - users should use <code>numpy.genfromtxt</code> instead with\nthe appropriate value for the <code>usemask</code> parameter.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/numpy/numpy/pull/19615\">gh-19615</a>)</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

I was just trying to find time over next weekends to update the SLEAP import functions (the current import scripts where written some years ago) and I was hoping to make the code a bit more robust, and error messages a bit more meaningful. However I don't have yoo many SLP projects and or vidoes tracked with sleap to troubleshoot with to help me catch and foresee possible errors. Would you mind sharing your SimBA project and SLP files you are trying to import into SimBA (with original videos) in a gdrive with me? Would be super helpful. \r\n\r\nThat said, the `cannot set a row with mismatched columns` error suggests that there are more, or less, body-parts in the SLP files than SimBA expects. The number of body-parts SimBA expects is dictated by the number of body-parts you specified when creating your project. To find out how many body-parts that SimBA expects, you can check the `project_folder\\logs\\measures\\pose_configs\\bp_names\\project_bp_names.csv` file, which should contain one row for each body-part. Also, do you see any errors in the Windows terminal window when this error shows in SimBA? ",

I noticed that the way I labeled them in SLEAP is different from how they are titled there, so I did change what was in that file to match what is in SLEAP. After doing that, I still have the same error. Let me know if I should change that back too. \r\n\r\nI don't have an error or any information show in the terminal when I try to upload my .slp file, but I do when I try to upload an h5 file. ",

I wrote about some suggested solutions under point 11 [HERE](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md#11-when-i-install-or-update-simba-i-see-a-bunch-or-messages-in-the-console-telling-there-me-about-some-dependency-conflicts-the-messages-may-look-a-little-like-this). \r\n\r\nHowever it looks more like a warning rather than the installations actually erroring out. If you type `simba` in the terminal after seeing these msgs, does SimBA still launch?\r\n\r\nPS.  `pip install scikit-learn --upgrade` should upgrade the package rather than `pip install --upgrade scikit-learn`",

I have encountered some problems during the installation process. First of all, I am not able to extract the files in FFmpeg in step 6 of the directions for installing FFmpeg. Could you let me know how to complete these steps and extract the files? I have included screenshots showing this as well.\r\n\r\nAlso, I am having trouble launching simba once I complete the installation steps.\r\n\r\nI have highlighted here the command line with the prompts I used and the errors I received. Could you help me figure out what I am doing wrong so that I am able to install the program?

        "body": "Hi,\r\nI'm building an analysis model with only one classified behavior. \r\nThe model is based on 24 videos, where this behavior on average is present around 1.4% of all frames labeled. This ratio (1.4%) is also the same in other videos that I've not incorporated in the model.\r\n\r\nI've read your papers ([1](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.19.049452 ) - [2](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00213-020-05577-x)) and I was wondering if this aspect (the low presence of the behavior in the videos) can affect negatively the model, because as you wrote \"One weakness of random forests is their inability to natively support biased datasets. These datasets are common in behavioral videos, in which most frames do not contain the behavior of interest\" (or \"Random forest classifiers - as other classification techniques - are sensitive to class imbalances\").\r\n\r\nIf this is the case, should I change any hyperparameters in the settings? And how?\r\nI see (and read in the papers) \"Under sample setting\" and \"Under sample ratio\" parameters: do I have to change their values?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n",

                "body": "Hi @carlitomu!\r\nYes, this imbalance (98.6% no behavior vs 1.4% behavior) is typical, and one of the main hurdles for getting an accurate classifier up and running. The issue is that the classifier can reach 98.6% accuracy, just by guessing \"no behavior\" on all frames, and we need to stop this from happening.\r\n\r\nThere are a few ways to solve this, in SimBA I recommend first trying the random undersampling. To do this, first set the\r\n`Under sample setting` entry box to `Random undersample` and set the `Under sample ratio` entry box to `1.0`. This number means that you will enter all of your behavior frames into the algorithm, and an equal count of \"no behavior\" frames.\r\nE.g., if you have 1000 frames annotated with the behavior present, and enter `1.0` in the `Under sample ratio`box, SimBA will use those together with 1000 randomly selected non-behavior frames.\r\n\r\nIf you insert `0.8` in the `Under sample ratio` entry box, SimBA will use the 1000 annotated frames, together with 800 randomly selected non-behavior frames.\r\n\r\nIf you insert `1.2` in the `Under sample ratio` entry box, SimBA will use the 1000 annotated frames, together with 1200 randomly selected non-behavior frames.\r\n\r\nWhich exact number to use for the `Under sample ratio` is empirical and depends on your behavior and videos, but `1.0` is usually a good place to start! If you see that the classifier is over-classifying frames as containing your behavior, then increase the `Under sample ratio`. If the classifier is under-classifying frames as containing your behavior, then try to decrease the `Under sample ratio`.",

                "body": "Hi @rfkova! \r\n\r\nSimBA first reads in the number of frames with predictions in your `labels.v000.video0.slp` SLP file. For this it counts the number of entries in the `['frames’]` key in the SLP file, and finds an array of `55391` entries. \r\n\r\nNext, it to get the actual body-part predictions, SimBA looks in the ['predicted_points’] key in the SLP file and finds 329244 rows. If we divide 329244 by the number of body-parts (which is 6), we get predictions for `54874` frames.\r\n\r\nPS: When looking at the number of frames in the actual video, there seems to be a count of `107914`.\r\n\r\nThe `(cannot set a row with mismatched columns)` you are seeing happens when SimBA tries to analyze frame `54875` of the anticipated `55391` frames. This returns zero body-part predictions. SimBA tries to insert the zero body-part predictions into 6*3 (body-part count * (X, Y, P)) column dataframe, just like the the other prior predicted frames. But - with zero values - that’s not going to work and it fails. \r\n\r\nI have not seen this error before, there is a few things we can do. We can insert a fix where we treat the ['predicted_points’] key as the actual true frame count, or alternative the true frame count is whatever is the smallest (['predicted_points’] or ['frames’]). However the two counts normally match up, I don’t know why it wouldn’t match up here, and even if we use one of these solutions, we’d still only have predictions for the first half-ish of the video. Let me know if that makes sense!",

Due to a bug I'm working out with the SLEAP team I wasn't able to run predictions on 100% of the frames so in lieu of that I predicted 1000 random frames at a time until I got to around 50% of frames labeled which is what we have here. The videos are 30fps so this should give me around 15fps labeled frames and I planned to interpolate (using tools in SimBA) intermediate body part locations for this first test phase. \r\n\r\nThe numbers you give match perfectly 54874-55391 = 517 which is precisely the number of manually labeled frames. I think for some reason SLEAP didn't enter frames for previously labeled frames which appear to have been logged under predictions if I understand you correctly. Under normal circumstances I think I can get around this by simply making a separate file and trying to predict all frames without doing any manual labeling but at present that's not working for me.\r\n\r\nThe problem we face is what you say - we don't know which of the 'predictions' correspond to the manual labels which are missing so we wouldn't know which 'predictions' to discard to match frames. \r\n\r\nSomething in the way you phrased what you wrote also suggests that my intended approach might not work anyway in that there may be no index of frame order indicating un-predicted frames... would SimBA treat my ~50k predicted frames as contiguous making interpolation infeasible?\r\n\r\nEither way, I think this may be a problem I have to fix on the SLEAP end of things.\r\n\r\nLet me know about the feasibility of this approach for my test scenario and if it won't work I'll mark this issue solved and work from the SLEAP end of things. If it could work I will dig a little deeper to find if there's a way to ID which frames to drop and update with thread with the results before marking solved.\r\n\r\nThanks again!!!\r\n\r\n",

We assume that the first row in this sheet always has a row beginning with `Number of header lines:` which tells us how many rows in the beginning of the sheet contain only meta information. \r\n3. We assume that one row of the header lines in the second sheet will begin with `Video file`, and tells us the name of the video that we are analyzing (we need this to pull fps etc). \r\n4.

        "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nExecuting a batch pre-process video task errors out with multiple \"file not found\" errors after the first task is run. After looking at the list of commands to run outputted by SimBA, it appears absolute paths are used most of the time, except for the final `mv` command after a task. See below for instance:\r\n```\r\ncp \"/home/florian/Documents/Temp/TEST/input_videos/MVI_0061.MP4\" \"/home/florian/Documents/Temp/TEST/processed_videos/\"\r\nffmpeg -y -i \"/home/florian/Documents/Temp/TEST/processed_videos/MVI_0061.MP4\" -vf \"crop=749:701:457:9\" -c:v libx264 -c:a copy \"/home/florian/Documents/Temp/TEST/processed_videos/MVI_0061_cropped.mp4\"\r\nmv \"/home/florian/Documents/Temp/TEST/processed_videos/MVI_0061.MP4\" \"/home/florian/Documents/Temp/TEST/processed_videos/tmp/\"\r\ncp \"/home/florian/Documents/Temp/TEST/processed_videos/MVI_0061_cropped.mp4\" \"/home/florian/Documents/Temp/TEST/processed_videos/tmp/\"\r\nmv \"/home/florian/Documents/Temp/TEST/processed_videos/MVI_0061_cropped.mp4\" \"MVI_0061.MP4\"\r\n```\r\nAs you can see in the last `mv` command, the destination does not include the outputDir. It thus also seems to overwrite the input video (I still need to confirm that, though).\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Go to 'Videos' > 'Batch pre-process videos'\r\n2. Enter multiple tasks for at least one video.\r\n4. Execute the task(s).\r\n5. The outputDir is prepared correctly, the input video is copied to that folder, the `tmp` dir is also correctly created, and the first `ffmpeg` operation completes successfully.\r\n6. The process fails with a \"no such file or directory\" error when trying to run the second task on the video.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nAll pre-process tasks complete successfully, without overwriting the original video.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nNA.\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: openSUSE Tumbleweed\r\n - Python Version: 3.6\r\n - Are you using anaconda? yes.\r\n \r\n**Additional Context**\r\nAfter a quick look at the code, it appears it could be related to the following (and the related line for other pre-processing tasks):\r\nhttps://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/4cac1f8c7864d752bdb49251d4f3b098f7041124/simba/process_videos_automation_linux.py#L142\r\n\r\nShouldn't that include the `outputdir` in the destination? something like (untested):\r\n```python\r\n                    'mv \\\"' + os.path.join(str(outputdir),output) + '\" \"' + os.path.join(str(outputdir),os.path.basename(currentFile)+'\"')\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks for your time!",

I have a 2 animal project in Deeplabcut that I want to analyse. \r\n\r\nI checked #150 and two other previous questions related but their solutions do not seem to solve what is happening to me. \r\n\r\nI created a new pose configuration with 2x7 bps which seems to work fine. I successfully imported two videos, which have the same name and are in the same folder than their .h5 files, but when I try to import the .h5 files it says \r\n\r\n_\"Importing 0 multi-animal DLC h5 files to the current project\"_\r\n\r\nI installed simba in a conda environment and the version is:\r\nsimba-uw-tf               1.3.12\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n",

It maybe that the namings have changed in earlier or later versions of graphviz. \r\n\r\nIf you do a `pip show graphviz` what do yo see? If you don't see version `0.11`, could you do a `pip install graphviz==0.11` and see if that fixes it? (that is the version I have on my machine). ",

They work for creating classifiers from 3D data, I just haven’t found time to get it into the SimBA GUI and accept parameters from SimBA project file, right now I don’t think I will be able to get it done any time soon unfortunately. \r\n\r\nMain thing you’d have to change beginning of import script to handle Anipose data (DANNCE data is mat format and I don’t know how Anipose data looks like). If you have an Anipose data file would you be willing to share it together with the video? This would make it possible for us to write the necessary code eventually when time allows. Sorry I can't be more help at the moment..\r\n\r\nOnce these things are running, there are also amendments to make in ancillary scripts (e.g., calculate movement distances, ROI scripts etc) to accommodate 3D data (e.g., `if pose_estimation == 3D: calculate euclid distances in 3D rather than 2D`.\r\n",

Anyway, if you give me an email to share the data I'd make it available on my google drive. I'll take a look at the code you uploaded and see if I can make some progress there.\r\n\r\nThe data is a work in progress so the tracking or reconstruction have some issues (it's a weird model that I kinda lost track of and is now a little messy). I'm in the middle of creating a new model with a set of labels you propose for 2 animals and will now be using maDLC as I have 2 rats and it seems to help for the one that has a socket on it's head which often obstructs the view of snout or one of the ears.

The data from APT I've seen and read about is in the `numpoints x numdimensions x numframes x numtargets` format, meaning if you track three animals, with 8 body-parts each, with a single camera, for 12000 frames you have an array that is 8x2x12000x3 - https://kristinbranson.github.io/APT/appendices.html#Trk%20file%20contents\r\n\r\nSimBA however sees your data shape as 14556x2x11. If I had to guess it is 14556 frames, one camera, 11 body-parts, and a single animal. I've actually seen this issue before (the different order, beginning with the frames dimension) and SimBA already has a fix to re-organize the data into the appropriate format. What we don't have a fix for, however, is the last dimension - your data is NxNxN but the APT data I've seen is NxNxNxN - thats why you get the error of the missing axis.\r\n\r\n.. anyhow I will insert the fix - I just want to confirm that it is a single animal you are tracking so I don't head down the wrong path?

However, it has been 6 hours since I started the outlier correction process and the main SimBA window is still displaying the following message:\r\n```\r\nPose-estimation body part setting for outlier correction: 9\r\nApplying settings for classical tracking...\r\nProcessing 1 files for movement outliers...\r\n```\r\n\r\nPressing \"Run outlier correction\" generated the following error in the terminal:\r\n```\r\nException in Tkinter callback\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/home/blackmonlab/anaconda3/envs/simbaenv/lib/python3.6/tkinter/__init__.py\", line 1705, in __call__\r\n    return self.func(*args)\r\n  File \"/home/blackmonlab/anaconda3/envs/simbaenv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/simba/SimBA.py\", line 6092, in correct_outlier\r\n    dev_move_user_defined(configini)\r\n  File \"/home/blackmonlab/anaconda3/envs/simbaenv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/simba/outlier_scripts/movement/correct_devs_mov_user_defined.py\", line 120, in dev_move_user_defined\r\n    csv_df.columns = colHeads\r\n  File \"/home/blackmonlab/anaconda3/envs/simbaenv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pandas/core/generic.py\", line 5192, in __setattr__\r\n    return object.__setattr__(self, name, value)\r\n  File \"pandas/_libs/properties.pyx\", line 67, in pandas._libs.properties.AxisProperty.__set__\r\n  File \"/home/blackmonlab/anaconda3/envs/simbaenv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pandas/core/generic.py\", line 690, in _set_axis\r\n    self._data.set_axis(axis, labels)\r\n  File \"/home/blackmonlab/anaconda3/envs/simbaenv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pandas/core/internals/managers.py\", line 183, in set_axis\r\n    \"values have {new} elements\".format(old=old_len, new=new_len)\r\nValueError: Length mismatch: Expected axis has 25 elements, new values have 27 elements\r\n```\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nThe video and DeepLabCut data are attached as Google Drive files at the bottom of this post. To prep the video, I just cropped it a bit.\r\nTo get this error, I followed the steps from the SimBA ReadTheDocs, SimBA Pipeline section. Below are the specific parameters I used for each step which required user input:\r\n\r\nIn Part 1, Steps 1.4-1.5, I specified 9 behaviors:\r\n1. Suspension\r\n2. Bottom Skimming\r\n3. Drifting\r\n4. Fast Turning\r\n5. Flit Swimming\r\n6. Pushing Against Tank Wall\r\n7. Slow Turning\r\n8. Sustained Swimming\r\n9. Other\r\n\r\nIn Part 1, Step 1.6, I specified classic tracking\r\n\r\nFor Part 1, Step 1.7, I specified 1 animal, 9 body parts\r\n\r\nIn Part 2, Step 3.1, I set Distance_in_mm to 225 mm (the length of the top of my fish's tank)\r\n\r\nIn Part 2, Step 3.6, I drew a line across top of tank\r\n\r\nIn Part 2, Step 4.2, I used nose and tail as reference body parts\r\n\r\nIn Part 2, Step 4.3, I listed 120mm for both Movement criterion and Location criterion. I know these are both probably bad parameters. I used them because the maximum size of the fish is 120mm (though mine are probably closer to 50mm). I will probably adjust them once I can see the results of outlier correction.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nReadTheDocs indicates I should expect to find 2 log files in the ```/project_folder/logs/``` directory upon successful completion, and presumably a message stating that the program is looking for location outliers, followed by some sort of \"done\" message\r\n\r\n**Desktop**\r\nUbuntu 18.04\r\nPython 3.6.10\r\nI am using Anaconda\r\n \r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nHere is a Google Drive Folder with the video and DeepLabCut tracking data I am using in this process. Please don't hesitate to message me if there are sharing issues:\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JB3nE14e3-8AcZE0DsZ0F1wXpwmMqM_J?usp=sharing\r\n",

                "body": "Hi @AnnabelPerry - yes you are right it is related to the outlier extraction, let's try to get passed it. \r\n\r\n(i) SimBA takes the files inside of the the `project_folder/csv/outlier_corrected_movement_location` folder and extracts features from these files. A `feature` in your case, could be the angular rotation of the fish, the velocity of the fish body-parts etc. The message `Extracting features from 0 files..` suggests that there are 0 files inside of this folder in your project, so we need to get this folder populated so we have files to extract features from. \r\n\r\n(ii) The `Pose-estimation body part setting for feature extraction: 9` message suggests that you are sing one of SimBAs built in pose-estimation configurations. I don't think this is accurate, as you are classifying behaviors of fish, and there is no built in configuration for fish as the moment. That message should be reading `user-defined` rather than `9`.\r\n\r\n(iii) The core issue probably comes from point ii, where SimBA thinks you have 9 in-built body-parts  but you don't. When you click `skip outlier correction` SimBA tries to apply the in-built body-part names to your CSV files but fails as your pose-estimation files contains more/less body-parts. Could you try to use a user-defined body-part configuration and see if that fixes it?",

With six animals and two roles (approach vs approached) there are a lot of permutations making it difficult to solve post-hoc with heuristic rules as well... It makes 15 permutations of animal combinations, 30 permutations if you want the roles I think.. The most immediate solution that comes to mind is:\r\n\r\n1. The classifier should only take in features values relevant to two animals at any one time (SimBA currently takes all), run the classifier for each of the animal combinations.\r\n2. To find the roles: when classifier says behavior present, look at the feature values and find animal that have bodyparts which show movement, and body-parts with fastest decreasing distance to the original location of the other animals body-parts at the start of the approach bout (i.e.,  compare animal 1 movement against the location of animal 2 in the beginning of the bout as a static, and then the inverse).  This should cover for situations where both animals are approaching each other as well. ",

But training 15 classifiers per social behavior is a bit too onerous (that would make it ~100 classifiers for several behaviors). \r\n\r\nIs there a potentially simpler solution, something along these lines:\r\n\r\n3.  Select a social behavior and select two animals that exhibit many examples of social interaction. Feed just those features into simba and train a classifier. \r\n\r\n4.  Then write a function that applies the classifier to all pair-wise animals for the prediction step.\r\n\r\nIt's not clear to me how bad this would do?!  There appear to be some feature engineering in simba (though perhaps not as much as in jaaba):\r\n- euclidean distance \r\n- body movement\r\n- all_bp movements\r\n- sum eucldiean distance\r\n- mean euclidean distance\r\n\r\nAnd of these features perhaps only bp movements matter because of the animal sizes (in our case adults vs. pups).  But inter-feature distance will not be relevant to most basic social behaviors such as approach, chase, etc.\r\n\r\nIf you think this might work, I'd be happy to try and write an extension for simba that:\r\n- Optionally: asks user to select 2 animals pre training. (Though a faster option might be to ask end user to select this pre-simba; but we could also put this function really early on in simba so that the selected 2 animals propagate through all routines).\r\n- Multi-animal-prediction: asks user to load a pairwise classifier and a feature file and applies classifier to all pairwise animals in the feature file.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think.\r\n\r\n[Edit:] One additional step that could help for gross social behaviors would be to collapse all features to body centroids and feed single-feature animal locations. This would avoid the bp feature confusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Then pick out all features with `Animal_1` and `Animal_3` and run classifier on those features and so on for all permutations.

                "body": "Hi @AnnabelPerry! First,  SimBA has no SQL dependencies or currently store data in SQL format, and not sure why it would try to connect to SQL server. If you see those error again: terminate your session, and make sure you are installing SimBA in a fresh conda environment. \r\n\r\nThe rest of the errors, however, seems very similar to the errors reported by another user this morning, who is also working in Linux or MacOS. https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/issues/154\r\n\r\nCan you try to install simba with `pip install simba-uw-tf-dev --no-deps` and see if that fixes it? It seems related to MacOS/Linus and the installation of wxpython. Also make sur you are running python 3.6.10 ",

                "body": "Thank you for your rapid response!\r\nSo I'd actually tried re-installing SimBA with no dependencies a couple days ago. It installed properly, but I encountered an issue in the GUI where it would fail with an error when I tried to crop videos. I tried replicating the error just now, but it appears to have installed successfully this time. Here's what I did:\r\nI removed the old environment and reran these steps (with the no dependencies flag):\r\n```\r\nconda create -n simbaenv python=3.6.10 \r\n\r\nconda activate simbaenv \r\n\r\npip install simba-uw-tf-dev --no-deps\r\n\r\npip uninstall shapely \r\n\r\nconda install -c conda-forge shapely \r\n```\r\n\r\nI then ran the ```simba``` command, getting this error:\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/home/blackmonlab/anaconda3/envs/simbaenv/bin/simba\", line 5, in \r\n    from simba.SimBA import main\r\n  File \"/home/blackmonlab/anaconda3/envs/simbaenv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/simba/SimBA.py\", line 6, in \r\n    import seaborn as sns\r\nModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'seaborn'\r\n```\r\n\r\nI ran ```pip install seaborn```, getting this error:\r\n```\r\nERROR: pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account all the packages that are installed.

I have yet to encounter any issues preprocessing videos, but if the ```wxpython``` error becomes a problem I'll open a new issue!

It looks like there aren't any files in the folder, I can see that the **feature extraction** step failed: `Extracting features from 0 files`. This suggests that the step before this, the outlier correction, might not have been completed - I recommend you click on the red `skip outlier correction` button the the `[Outlier correction]` tab. This should give you files to generate features for. The printouts in your screenshot suggests the video is fine. \r\n\r\nJust a note, I can see the _readthedocs_ documentation. I have not written that and do not maintain and haven't read it, I don't think anyone in the lab is developing or maintaining those docs. I recommend the github mds' for the docs https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba#scenario-tutorials",

SimBA, however, assumes that there should be 126 columns, which means that there is either an extra body-part for each animal, or an extra animal. \r\n\r\nWhen you click `skip outlier correction`, SimBA takes the imported pose-estimation files, and without performing any outlier correction, just modifies the headings to make it compatible with the rest of the functions down-stream, and make similar regardless of the pose-estimation tool it comes from (sleap, dlc, animal tracker etc..) It is here SimBA tries to fit 126 headers to a 108-field file and this is the reason you see the error. When you specified the body-parts, is it possible you added an animal too many or a body-part too many?  \r\n\r\nWhen you define the body-parts, the data is saved in a CSV at `project_folder/logs/measures/body_parts_configuration/body_configurations.csv` (or something very similar, I can't remember exact). You could open this file in your project and check for any odd ones that should not be there?\r\n",

From there, by clicking \"draw\" the frame pops out and I can proceed to drawing... but from scratch. Maybe I deleted my previous drawing yesterday when I tried different strategies to make the ROI interface work... So for the future, in case i want to resume to an interrupted drawing, must I use the new interface area only? \r\n\r\nAlso, when do you think it will be possible to draw shapes with specific precise sizes? \r\nI need to draw several shapes of the same dimensions with very precise lengths. But this is very difficult because the option to define lengths is not yet functional and the drawing of the shapes does not yet allow to make squares with the 4 sides automatically having the same length.\r\n\r\nThank you for the help and for developping this amazing soft, \r\n\r\nBest, \r\nDorian \r\n",

I’m not sure why this happened at the moment but a possibility:\r\n\r\nYour drawing information is stored in a file located at `project_folder/logs/measures/ROI_definitions.h5`. This file is created the first time you use the “standard” ROI drawing interface for a project, or the first time you use the new “experimental” interface. If the file already exists, then SimBA will open it instead of a creating a new file when you click `load defined ROI tables` or when open the experimental interface. If you have created ROI drawings in the experimental interface, you won’t be able to open it in the old interface, or vice versa. So better stick to one. The error could also happen if you change video or file-names after you have created your ROI drawings. For the future, I would stick to using the experimental interface. Future updates and bug fixes will be made to this interface in mind.  \r\n\r\nI will insert the Drawing ROIs with pre-set dimensions, but it is not on top of the list. For now, I would recommend the **duplicate ROI function**:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/ROI_tutorial_new.md#duplicating-rois\r\n\r\nThis at least makes sure that all your shapes are the same dimensions. You can also make sure that they are perfectly aligned and exactly the same dimensions with this function:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/ROI_tutorial_new.md#aligning-rois\r\n\r\nI know that this does not allow you to draw multiple shapes of one specific metric dimensions, but it is the best we can do, for now.

I have 49 videos of mice each 5-7 minutes long. My question is how many videos should I annotate (approximately) to build a good classifier, at least as a start? I understand it depends on the number of times a behaviour is present in each video, but since rearing is a quite common behaviour for the OFT, I suspect I shouldn't need that many videos, but I have no idea how many could possibly be enough. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance.

From videos of 10 different animals, find a 1-2 min stretch where you see BOTH supported and unsupported rearing. \r\n2. Pull that timeclip from  your video using tools -> clip video into multiple video (this will make a short video labeled yourvideoname-clip1 in your videos folder). \r\n3. Label these ten short clips, train your classifier, and see how it's doing on a video from an animal you did not train the classifier on. You may need to add a few more clips in, but rearing is a pretty distinct behavior so I don't think you'll need to label a ton of videos. \r\nIn general, you want to label a little bit of data from several different animals to get generalizable classifiers.

For example, if the hull is small, but some body-parts like the tail or nose is still moving, it might not be freezing behavior any more? The hull is also the smallest when the animal is rearing, and the animal probably can’t freeze and rear at same time? I’d say to find freezing, **it is much easier and more accurate to train a model that finds the correlations for you**",

This, of course, isn't one of the pre-defined options for the pose config, so I'm having to create a new one.  The problem is that with so many body parts, the Save Pose Config button gets pushed off screen even with the window at max size, and with no way to scroll down it becomes inaccessible.\r\n\r\nI've tried hitting the tab button until it's (I think, I can't see to know for sure) selected and hitting enter, but this doesn't work either (either that or I need to fill in the Image Path section, but I haven't found anything telling me what that is).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

SimBA wants you to select a directory, not a file. I am not how it is possible to select a file in this part of the program, which version of SimBA are you running? \r\n\r\nIn your file path, there are some funky characters (`$`) and full stops (`Marcel.Moor`), could you see if it works if you move the files from the server to the local computer and see if it works then? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Go to 'Tools'\r\n2. Click on 'Multi-crop'\r\n3. Click on \"Browse Folder\" and enter absolute path to folder containing the videos `/path/to/videos/folder/`: the *Video Folder* text area then shows `path/to/videos/folder`. \r\n4. Enter `mp4` as *Video type*\r\n5. This results in the search path being: `/path/to/videos/folder./*.mp4`: this results in no video file being found despite the given folder including a `.mp4` video file.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe video(s) should be correctly found.\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: [e.g. iOS] openSUSE Leap 15.2\r\n - Python Version [e.g. 3.6.0]: 3.6.10\r\n - Are you using anaconda? yes (miniconda3)\r\n \r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n`SimBA` was installed as follows.\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nconda create -n simbaenv -c conda-forge python=3.6.10 wxpython=4.0.4\r\nconda activate simbaenv\r\npip install simba-uw-no-tf\r\npip uninstall shapely\r\nconda install -c conda-forge shapely\r\nconda install -c conda-forge ffmpeg\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Workaround**\r\nManually adding the removed trailing slash in `multicrop.py` works:\r\nCurrent:\r\nhttps://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/b69668bbe0e11a95f6d69b0efb587290f0753bd3/simba/multiplecrop.py#L10\r\n\r\nReplaced by:\r\n```python\r\n    videoFtype = \"/.\" + '/*.' + vtype\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm not familiar with Tkinter and how paths are processed from the user input (or even if it's Tkinter responsible here), so I wouldn't be surprised if it's related to the fact that I'm running under Linux (which I believe is not supported for SimBA). I'm not sure it qualifies for a fix as a result but it would certainly be appreciated if a simple cross-platform solution exists.\r\n\r\nIn advance, thanks a lot for your time!\r\n",

You can install it via `pip install simba-uw-tf-dev`. \r\n\r\nDespite the `tf` in the package name, `simba-uw-tf-dev` does **not** use TensorFlow, and does not support the [in-built DLC interface](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/Multi_animal_pose.md) or the [in-built DeepPoseKit interface](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/DeepPoseKit_in_SimBA.md). \r\n\r\nTherefor, you will have to generate your pose-estimation inside the pose-estimation packages and their interfaces (for example DLC on colab) - and then import the analyzed CSV or H5 files into the SimBA project created by the `simba-uw-tf-dev` package. \r\n\r\nLet me know if that makes sense!",

It should be the opposite, but in any case, both walked far more than 4 cm.\r\nI also looked at the movement within ROIs, and the results are totally differents: \r\n\r\n![Untitled3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66886884/116073355-97f74c00-a690-11eb-9ef4-a129974a5405.png)\r\n\r\nThe cells, from left to right show movement in compartment 1 to 4 for mouse 1, and for mouse 2. \r\nThese data fit more what I observe (overall mouse 2 walked more than mouse 1), but still, it seems that mouse 2 walked only 3 meters overall which is no true, he walked much more for sure (our device is 2.5 meter long and it crossed it several times). \r\n\r\nFinally while mouse 1 never entered compartment 4, SimBA quantified a non-null movments / distance there. I don't understand cause, after having corrected the ID swaps on DLC, there is no more frame with mouse 1 in the compartment 4. \r\n\r\nWould you have a suggestion to get a reliable quantification of distance for each mouse?\r\n\r\nThank you, \r\nBest,\r\nDorian ",

When you export your H5's from DLC, make sure you are not filtering the data based on probabilities. Take it all. SimBA should fill in the blanks with zeros - but generally - do not filter/remove any of your DLC output. \r\n\r\n3) What's happening based on this picture: \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50497030/115927741-c16a6a80-a439-11eb-8a9f-33ad643d0018.png)\r\n\r\n... suggests that SimBA never imported the files correctly. This suggests that SimBA is looking in your `project_folder/csv/input_csv` directory for files, and finds `0` files. Could you make sure that the files are there?

Could you try remove the DLC appended string to the filenames (e.g., `DLC_resnet_50_Arena-CD1-protocol2-ph2Apr12shuffle1_6000_bx`) and see if it works?

We do however use subject sometimes when we have two animals to define which animal is doing what but for what we currently are trying to use SIMBA for this is unimportant and probably complicated to import in a useful way. \r\n\r\nI had a go with your script and it didn't work. But I really appreciate all of your work so I took some time and got it working. I'm not sure how pythonic my solution is though. Essentially once you import the whole CSV as data frame it sets Observation id and the following cell as the headers so when you try to run the skip it doesn't work. So I just reimport after finding the index. Also in order for splitext to work properly you should already get the basename. Here is the entire section that is working now on my pc. \r\n`    \r\n[BorisOutput.xlsx](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/files/6316876/BorisOutput.xlsx)\r\n\r\n\r\n        currDf = pd.read_csv(file)\r\n        index=(currDf[currDf['Observation id']==\"Time\"].index.values)\r\n        currDf = pd.read_csv(file,skiprows=range(0, int(index+1))) \r\n        currDf = currDf.loc[:, ~currDf.columns.str.contains('^Unnamed')]\r\n        currDf.dropna()\r\n        currDf.drop(['Behavioral category', 'Comment', 'Subject'], axis=1, inplace=True)\r\n        for index, row in currDf.iterrows():\r\n            currPath = row['Media file path']\r\n            currBase= os.path.basename(currPath)\r\n            currDf.at[index, 'Media file path'] = os.path.splitext(currBase)[0]\r\n        combinedDf = pd.concat([combinedDf, currDf])\r\n`\r\nI have attatched a Boris output with 2 videos.

Naming is consistent with previous feature_scripts.\r\n\r\nClassifiers trained with this feature selection can be used with the optimized feature extraction script (by Simon) in DLStream that pushes classfication time down to sub pose estimation inference speed. A huge benefit. It was already used for anogenital approach classification. See [DLStream Code](https://github.com/SchwarzNeuroconLab/DeepLabStream/blob/dev_classification/experiments/custom/featureextraction.py) and [DLStream Wiki](https://github.com/SchwarzNeuroconLab/DeepLabStream/wiki/Advanced-Behavior-Classification).\r\n\r\nHopefully this will enable the community to directly train \"real-time\" optimized classification in SiMBA and implement them into DLStream.

These videos are only around 28 seconds and contain 700 frames. \r\nI would like to create a classifier that would identify pronation, supination and lingering of the forelimb on the spoon as well as an overall classifier for detecting outcome (successful pellet reach or unsuccessful). \r\nI have already tried using SimBA but fear I may have used behavioural annotation incorrectly, marking frames individually rather than a frame range which would contain temporal data. \r\nMy question is, would this software actually work for this purpose and would it be able to take a chunk of frames marked as \"successful pellet retrieval\" and make an efficient classifier? \r\nThank you in advance!\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65357758/108206742-b6841880-711e-11eb-92ad-7b14165dcb1f.mp4\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The video won't play or download for some reason, if you share a gdrive link I could take a look -goldenneurolab@gmail.com \r\n\r\nSome thoughts, I'm not sure how pronation, supination and lingering looks like but generally, if you can identify a behavior by eye, and the behavior has a meaningful duration (e.g., the animal performed 3 bouts of supination for a total duration of 1.5) then you can use SimBA to get to that. \r\n\r\nI mention \"meaningful duration\" because of your second question - about successful reaching. Successful reaching doesn't really fill this criterion - SimBA will give you how many frames/ seconds/bouts successful reaching happened in - it is possible that the \"bouts\" of successful reaching that simba classifies is meaningful for you though.\r\n\r\nEach individual frame, annotated or not, does contain temporal data, up to 500ms - for each frame SimBA calculates these values - https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/misc/features_user_defined_pose_config.csv \r\n\r\nI mention this as if you annotate a single frame as \"successful reaching\", what is unique about that frame compared to 3 frames downstream which is not \"successful reaching\" - probably nothing or very little - and this will confuse the classifier. \r\nI'd try to annotate a whole segment as successful reaching and see if that works. \r\n\r\nI'd also set some very clear definitions of what successful reaching is before annotating - e.g., the forelimbs have to remain _this_ position after making _this_ motion or something similar - without that it be difficult for the annotator to label frames correctly and for the computer to separate the behaviors from the background.

This is because sometimes they can drop it as they pull their paw out and this is classed as a failure. That being said, does this mean I should label all the frames AFTER the paw is no longer in view as successful of failure? If thats the case the only frames contained in that classifier would be unannotated empty frames showing the spoon. Does SimBA somehow look at those frames in relation the the rest of the video? \r\nOr would it be best to label all frames containing the paw and pellet as success or fail instead? As in if frames 200-400 contain the paw reaching and grasping the pellet successfully then they should all be labelled as successful?\r\nThank you\r\nIlyaas",

Create a SimBA project and import these videos as documented [HERE](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/Multi_animal_pose.md). As you create the SimBA project you see a dropdown option for `workflow file type` which can be either `CSV` or `parquet`. With the size of your later data I'd recommend going for the parquet option - with hundreds of of hours of video then CSVs will cost you in terms of space and time. \r\n\r\n(iii) Once your project is created, and SLEAP pose is imported into your project, begin at this step of [Scenario 1](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/Scenario1.md#part-2-load-project-1). But again, what specifically happens next depends on your use case - if you are interested in non-classification stuff it's possible you'd be better off looking [here](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/ROI_tutorial.md) or [here](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/directionality_between_animals.md). What are you looking to score? \r\n\r\nIf you are looking to generate classifiers, then make sure the short videos you are importing has a good amount of behaviors that you are interested in, so you are not just feeding in no-behavior examples.  \r\n\r\nUnfortunately we designed SimBA to be GUI based, not as many objects as there should be - there is no going back right now and no notebooks to offer at the moment 🤷 . We are however happy to respond to any issues and explain/update code if there is something missing as you are troubleshooting and working through it. \r\n\r\n",

Specifically, inputs to such ops are rounded from 23 bits of precision to 10\nbits of precision. This is unlikely to cause issues in practice for deep learning models. In some cases, TensorFloat-32 is also used for complex64 ops.\nTensorFloat-32 can be disabled by running <code>tf.config.experimental.enable_tensor_float_32_execution(False)</code>.</li>\n<li>The byte layout for string tensors across the C-API has been updated to match TF Core/C++; i.e., a contiguous array of <code>tensorflow::tstring</code>/<code>TF_TString</code>s.</li>\n<li>C-API functions <code>TF_StringDecode</code>, <code>TF_StringEncode</code>, and <code>TF_StringEncodedSize</code> are no longer relevant and have been removed; see <code>core/platform/ctstring.h</code> for  string access/modification in C.</li>\n<li><code>tensorflow.python</code>, <code>tensorflow.core</code> and <code>tensorflow.compiler</code> modules are now hidden. These modules are not part of TensorFlow public API.</li>\n<li><code>tf.raw_ops.Max</code> and <code>tf.raw_ops.Min</code> no longer accept inputs of type <code>tf.complex64</code> or <code>tf.complex128</code>, because the behavior of these ops is not well defined for complex types.</li>\n<li>XLA:CPU and XLA:GPU devices are no longer registered by default. Use <code>TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_enable_xla_devices</code> if you really need them, but this flag will eventually be removed in subsequent releases.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>tf.keras</code>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>steps_per_execution</code> argument in <code>model.compile()</code> is no longer experimental; if you were passing <code>experimental_steps_per_execution</code>, rename it to <code>steps_per_execution</code> in your code. This argument controls the number of batches to run during each <code>tf.function</code> call when calling <code>model.fit()</code>. Running multiple batches inside a single <code>tf.function</code> call can greatly improve performance on TPUs or small models with a large Python overhead.</li>\n<li>A <strong>major refactoring</strong> of the internals of the Keras Functional API may affect code that\nis relying on certain internal details:\n<ul>\n<li>Code that uses <code>isinstance(x, tf.Tensor)</code> instead of <code>tf.is_tensor</code> when checking Keras symbolic inputs/outputs should switch to using <code>tf.is_tensor</code>.</li>\n<li>Code that is overly dependent on the exact names attached to symbolic tensors (e.g. assumes there will be &quot;:0&quot; at the end of the inputs, treats names as unique identifiers instead of using <code>tensor.ref()</code>, etc.) may break.</li>\n<li>Code that uses full path for <code>get_concrete_function</code> to trace Keras symbolic inputs directly should switch to building matching <code>tf.TensorSpec</code>s directly and tracing the <code>TensorSpec</code> objects.</li>\n<li>Code that relies on the exact number and names of the op layers that TensorFlow operations  were converted into may have changed.</li>\n<li>Code that uses <code>tf.map_fn</code>/<code>tf.cond</code>/<code>tf.while_loop</code>/control flow as op layers and  happens to work before TF 2.4. These will explicitly be unsupported now. Converting these ops to Functional API op layers was unreliable before TF 2.4, and prone to erroring incomprehensibly  or being silently buggy.</li>\n<li>Code that directly asserts on a Keras symbolic value in cases where ops like <code>tf.rank</code> used to  return a static or symbolic value depending on if the input had a fully static shape or not. Now these ops always return symbolic values.</li>\n<li>Code already susceptible to leaking tensors outside of graphs becomes slightly more likely to do so now.</li>\n<li>Code that tries directly getting gradients with respect to symbolic Keras inputs/outputs. Use <code>GradientTape</code> on the actual Tensors passed to the already-constructed model instead.</li>\n<li>Code that requires very tricky shape manipulation via converted op layers in order to work, where the Keras symbolic shape inference proves insufficient.</li>\n<li>Code that tries manually walking a <code>tf.keras.Model</code> layer by layer and assumes layers only ever have one positional argument. This assumption doesn't hold       true before TF 2.4 either, but is more likely to cause issues now.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

service</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition checkout the detailed <a href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/data_performance_analysis\">guide</a> for analyzing input pipeline performance with TF Profiler.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/TPUStrategy\"><code>tf.distribute.TPUStrategy</code></a> is now a stable API and no longer considered experimental for TensorFlow. (earlier <code>tf.distribute.experimental.TPUStrategy</code>).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/profiler\">TF Profiler</a> introduces two new tools: a memory profiler to visualize your model’s memory usage over time and a <a href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/profiler#events\">python tracer</a> which allows you to trace python function calls in your model. Usability improvements include better diagnostic messages and <a href=\"https://tensorflow.org/guide/profiler#collect_performance_data\">profile options</a> to customize the host and device trace verbosity level.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Introduces experimental support for Keras Preprocessing Layers API (<a href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/experimental/preprocessing?version=nightly\"><code>tf.keras.layers.experimental.preprocessing.*</code></a>) to handle data preprocessing operations, with support for composite tensor inputs. Please see below for additional details on these layers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>TFLite now properly supports dynamic shapes during conversion and inference. We’ve also added opt-in support on Android and iOS for <a href=\"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/lite/delegates/xnnpack\">XNNPACK</a>, a highly optimized set of CPU kernels, as well as opt-in support for <a href=\"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/lite/g3doc/performance/gpu_advanced.md#running-quantized-models-experimental\">executing quantized models on the GPU</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Libtensorflow packages are available in GCS starting this release. We have also started to <a href=\"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow#official-builds\">release a nightly version of these packages</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The experimental Python API <a href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/debugging/experimental/enable_dump_debug_info\"><code>tf.debugging.experimental.enable_dump_debug_info()</code></a> now allows you to instrument a TensorFlow program and dump debugging information to a directory on the file system. The directory can be read and visualized by a new interactive dashboard in TensorBoard 2.3 called <a href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/debugger_v2\">Debugger V2</a>, which reveals the details of the TensorFlow program including graph structures, history of op executions at the Python (eager) and intra-graph levels, the runtime dtype, shape, and numerical composistion of tensors, as well as their code locations.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Breaking Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Increases the <strong>minimum bazel version</strong> required to build TF to <strong>3.1.0</strong>.</li>\n<li><code>tf.data</code>\n<ul>\n<li>Makes the following (breaking) changes to the <code>tf.data</code>.</li>\n<li>C++ API: - <code>IteratorBase::RestoreInternal</code>, <code>IteratorBase::SaveInternal</code>, and <code>DatasetBase::CheckExternalState</code> become pure-virtual and subclasses are now expected to provide an implementation.</li>\n<li>The deprecated <code>DatasetBase::IsStateful</code> method is removed in favor of <code>DatasetBase::CheckExternalState</code>.</li>\n<li>Deprecated overrides of <code>DatasetBase::MakeIterator</code> and <code>MakeIteratorFromInputElement</code> are removed.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

SimBA tries to grab features in rolling windows, with the smalest window being the fps /  15. If you have less than 15fps, that number will be a float lower than 1, and you can't grab a rolling window size that length (the rolling window is less than a single frame). Check out out this for more information: https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/issues/56\r\n\r\nWhat you want to do (because you have a user defined body-part configuration, rather than 8 as in the linked issue above), is open the feature extraction script for user defined body-parts. In the linked issue, I point to changing a value in the `extract_features_8bp.py` file. You want to do **exactly** the same as in the issue, except you want to make the change to the `extract_features_user_defined.py`file. \r\n\r\nHope that makes sense and let me know how it goes! ",

        "body": "I'm putting this here as an issue rather than a pull request because I know at least one lab member has a part of this fix on the dev wheel. \r\n\r\nThere are three instances I can spot where a single animal project would run into problems due to the use of <Scaled_movement_M1_M2>. I didn't look exhaustively so it might pop up elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe first and most important is in <rf_model_run.py>.  Only 16 and 14 bp projects - which both assume two animals - are given size-scaled movement values.  A fix at line 130 would be something like:\r\n\r\n```if pose_estimation_body_parts == '8' or pose_estimation_body_parts == '7' or pose_estimation_body_parts == '4':\r\n            mousesize = (statistics.mean(outputDf['Mouse_nose_to_tail']))\r\n            mouse1Max = mousesize * 8\r\n            outputDf['Scaled_movement'] = (outputDf['Total_movement_all_bodyparts'] / (mouse1Max)).round(decimals=2)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe solution becomes more elegant if you also replace line 129 so outputs from single and multi animal projects are the same and can be more simply called elsewhere:\r\n```outputDf['Scaled_movement'] = outputDf['Scaled_movement_M1_M2'].round(decimals=2)```\r\nso you only have 'Scaled_movement' to work with, but how that column is built in the machine output depends on the BP schema.  The downside is you have to chase down all the <Scaled_movement_M1_M2> and change them to <Scaled_movement>.\r\n\r\nMore easily solved are having the processes that use <Scaled_movement_M1_M2>.  I spotted it at process_severity (\"Analyze Severity\" in the GUI) and in path_plot.  I know the dev wheel has a fix (although it is currently <Scaled_movement_M1> right now, and I've called it simply <Scaled_movement>…\r\n\r\n\r\nThese could be fixed by having <Scaled_movement> be output the same for both multianimal and single animal projects (as above) \r\n\r\nSo, if you want to keep the single and multianimal output separate:\r\n```        if severityBool == 'yes':\r\n            csv_df_combined[severityTarget] = csv_df[severityTarget].values\r\n            if noAnimals == 2:\r\n                csv_df_combined['Scaled_movement_M1_M2'] = csv_df['Scaled_movement_M1_M2'].values\r\n            else:\r\n                csv_df_combined['Scaled_movement'] = csv_df['Scaled_movement'].values\r\n            columnNames = list(csv_df_combined)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you want to merge them to make handling these data cleaner, just omit the conditional and use <Scaled_movement>. \r\n\r\n\r\nPlease do check me for mistakes.",

I spotted the issue and updated the pypi packages in `path_plot.py` and `rf_model_run.py` files. \r\n\r\nThe issue is that the \"severity\", as we designed it, was a way of checking how much animals are moving during interactions, and relies, as designed, on the user employing one of the built in body-part configurations. As you say though, there should nothing stopping users having one animal to employ it though (this is what I have fixed) - although the way it is coded it would be too much work for now to get it going with user defined body part configurations. \r\n\r\nI have to ensure that the user has one of the built in body-part configurations before calculating either the scaled movement for two animals, or one animal, not elegant I admit but my hope is that it works:\r\n\r\n````\r\nif pose_estimation_body_parts == '4' or '7' or '8' or '7':\r\n    mouse1size = (statistics.mean(outputDf['Mouse_1_nose_to_tail']))\r\n    mouse1Max = mouse1size * 8\r\n    outputDf['Scaled_movement_M1'] = (outputDf['Total_movement_all_bodyparts_M1'] / (mouse1Max))\r\nif pose_estimation_body_parts == '16' or pose_estimation_body_parts == '14':\r\n   mouse1size = (statistics.mean(outputDf['Mouse_1_nose_to_tail']))\r\n   mouse2size = (statistics.mean(outputDf['Mouse_2_nose_to_tail']))\r\n   mouse1Max = mouse1size * 8\r\n   mouse2Max = mouse2size * 8\r\n   outputDf['Scaled_movement_M1'] = (outputDf['Total_movement_all_bodyparts_M1'] / (mouse1Max))\r\n   outputDf['Scaled_movement_M2'] = (outputDf['Total_movement_all_bodyparts_M2'] / (mouse2Max))\r\n   outputDf['Scaled_movement_M1_M2'] = (outputDf['Scaled_movement_M1'] + outputDf['Scaled_movement_M2']) / 2\r\n   .....\r\n\r\n\r\n````\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The `ValueError` you are seeing may be related to this, because SimBA also can't find the number of columns to match the number of body-parts you have tracked. \r\n\r\nTo me this suggests that something may have changed in SLEAP since I wrote this import code, and conversations with other sleap users I have had, suggests that SLEAP now may generate multiple SLP files. Do you see any other SLP file generated when you ran inference in SLEAP, and if you do, can you try to import this file into SimBA?   \r\n\r\nFor the optimal resolution: it's the smallest possible resolution where you can still reliably see the behaviors your are interested in.  This will make any pose-estimation and visual renderings in SimBA the fastest it can be without loosing reliable pose, which is most important for accurate classification. ",

TensorFlow 1.15 is able to emulate 2.0 behavior using the <code>enable_v2_behavior()</code> function.\nThis enables writing forward compatible code: by explicitly importing either <code>tensorflow.compat.v1</code> or <code>tensorflow.compat.v2</code>, you can ensure that your code works without modifications against an installation of 1.15 or 2.0.</li>\n<li><code>EagerTensor</code> now supports numpy buffer interface for tensors.</li>\n<li>Add toggles <code>tf.enable_control_flow_v2()</code> and <code>tf.disable_control_flow_v2()</code> for enabling/disabling v2 control flow.</li>\n<li>Enable v2 control flow as part of <code>tf.enable_v2_behavior()</code> and <code>TF2_BEHAVIOR=1</code>.</li>\n<li>AutoGraph translates Python control flow into TensorFlow expressions, allowing users to write regular Python inside <code>tf.function</code>-decorated functions. AutoGraph is also applied in functions used with <code>tf.data</code>, <code>tf.distribute</code> and <code>tf.keras</code> APIS.</li>\n<li>Adds <code>enable_tensor_equality()</code>, which switches the behavior such that:\n<ul>\n<li>Tensors are no longer hashable.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

For what its worth, the body parts for animal 3 are exactly the same as for animal 2 but with the \"_3\" instead of the \"_2\".\r\n![pose_config](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62612214/93482385-a812a600-f8cd-11ea-8087-c42434d65aee.PNG)\r\n\r\n...but when I load the project the opening GUI only displays the body parts for animals 1 and 2 while omitting the bodyparts from animal 3.\r\n![opening_GUI](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62612214/93482642-ec9e4180-f8cd-11ea-8ca2-7f4c738a1ec2.PNG)\r\n\r\nThe mismatch error I'm getting is expecting 57 columns while the file has 69, a difference of 12 columns. Knowing that this data comes from DLC, which for each body part uses 3 columns (X, Y, and p-value), the error would be consistent with SIMBA not expecting animal_3 which has 4 body parts (a total of 12 columns). This corresponds to the opening GUI not displaying animal_3.......but I don't understand why its missing animal_3.",

The goal of the SimBA project is to create and track classifiers for multi-animal DLC data which includes 2 pups and 1 adult mouse. Our DLC H5 file contains both labeled multi-animal (for the 2 pups) body parts and unique body parts (for the adult). In order to troubleshoot this error, we have tried to split our H5 file into three separate tests: adult only, infants only, and the original merged dataset. The adult only data works perfectly with SimBA, but I'm finding unique issues with both the infants and the merged data.\r\n\r\nInfants Only:\r\nAlthough I am able to successfully import the video and tracking data for the 2 infants, the load project GUI is completely blank (i.e. only has the tabs on the top, but no buttons within.

Uninstall the version of SimBA you have - `pip uninstall simba-uw-tf` or `pip uninstall simba-uw-no-tf` \r\n\r\n2. Install the development version `pip install simba-uw-tf-dev` and create or load your project. I inserted a fix for this in this simba version the other day. Let me know how it goes! (this is soon going to become the master version). \r\n\r\n\r\nLonger answer: I'm working with a few labs with tracking scenarios just like yours. Originally I did not anticipate that different animals may have different number of tracked body-parts, and therefore `simba-uw-tf` and `simba-uw-no-tf`  versions gives you the error you are seeing. Different number of body-parts and differently named body-parts for different animals require more dynamic menus than earlier versions, and I've tried to fix this in the development version. \r\n\r\nThat said, the labs I'm working with that have several pups and a dam have yet to perfect their tracking models so the updates I've made with dynamic menues etc. in SimBA are in anticipation of them getting accurate DLC/SLEAP pose - so I haven't been able to verify it's working well throughout. So, if you report any errors you encounter with the development version here, it would be extremely helpful for me so I can tidy up any functions if needed!\r\n\r\n",

I've tried to recreate the error, I got a similar error to what you where seeing (with frames not displaying in some projects), but unfortunately I couldn't replicate that specific error msg. \r\n\r\nShort explanation, could you update SimBA and try again? `pip install simba-uw-tf==0.58`. SimBA now tries to put a text label on each animal in multi-animal projects (https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/Capturesss.JPG) and these labels could become messed up in the annotator in some tracking scenarios. I've inserted a fix to remove the labels if the error pops up. \r\n\r\nThe error you are seeing though, suggest the program can't find the specific frame. In your `project_folder/frames/input` folder, there should be a directory that has the same name as your video. If you are trying to label a video called `Video1.mp4`, you should have a folder in `project_folder\\frames\\input\\` directory called `Video1` which contains all the frames in your video, starting with `0.png`. Fot now, try to avoid spaces in the video and folder names.  \r\n\r\nAlso, when you try to open the annotator again in the new SimBA version, could you delete the `project_folder\\labelling_info.txt` file in your project before giving it a go?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Side-views can disrupt pose-estimation (protocols involving one or several freely moving animals allows scenarios where the bodyparts are completely hidden if cameras are side-view). Movements further away from the camera are also not the same real-life distances as movement close to the camera and SimBA does not take these differences into account. This is not so relevant for head-fixed reaching tasks though, but it is in freely moving protocols (e.g., I don’t know how your set-up looks like, but it may be difficult to cluster / classify different forms of seizures, when all you and the computer sees is the animals rear). \r\n2.\tNo, SimBA is about supervised machine learning for now and does not do clustering dimensionality/reduction.\r\n3.\tNo, SimBA only does supervised learning. I’d check out BSOID https://github.com/YttriLab/B-SOID, or VAME https://github.com/LINCellularNeuroscience/VAME, or VAE-SNE https://github.com/jgraving/vaesne and perhaps UMAP-learn https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/, HDBSCAN https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/hdbscan packages for feature calculations and clustering your pose-estimation data. \r\n4.\tSimBA can detect any behavior that you can reliably observe – the rule of thumb is if you can see it than you can train the classifier to see it. So if you are after new motifs, then the package links above would be the place to start.  \r\n",

And sure, it can be imported as a feature (but not through the GUI... )\r\n\r\nYou are correct, only static ROI's work. \r\n\r\nIn SimBA, once you have labelled your images for the behaviors of interest, there will be a CSV file for every annotated video in the `project_folder/csv/target_inserted` directory. SimBA will use all the columns (minus the annotations and pose-estimation body-part locations) as features. If you can append your mask information as one or several additional columns within these files, then those columns will also be used used, automatically, in SimBA, when creating the classifiers.\r\n\r\nI think the mask vertices can be represented as lists of various lengths, and it wouldn't work if you create, for example, two new columns in the  `project_folder/csv/target_inserted` files that each contain a list for every frame (the x, y cords of all the vertices). I don't know if it would be relevant, but if you instead had single values that somehow represent you nest mask features it would work nicely for behavioral predictions (i.e., nest_area mm2 or pixels). \r\n\r\nI don't know what you are looking to score but if you are only interested in if the animal body-part(s) are inside your mask rcnn region, then SimBA can't help at the moment, the code doesn't update the ROI coordinates for new frames, it assumes it is static. If that's what you are interested in you can check line 131-136 in ROI_analysis_2.py in SimBA to see how I did it - shapely has a function to check if a coordinate is in a polygon but my code only reads in the vertices once. \r\n\r\n```\r\npointList = []\r\nfor point in vertices:\r\n    pointList.append(geometry.Point(point))\r\npolyGon = geometry.Polygon([[p.x, p.y] for p in pointList])\r\nCurrPoint = Point(int(currentPoints[bodyparts]), int(currentPoints[bodyparts+arrayIndex]))\r\npolyGonStatus = (polyGon.contains(CurrPoint))\r\n```\r\n",

The number of body-parts that your project have also dictates how many and which features should be created. \r\n\r\nTo save your annotated images you first have to generate the features.

                "body": "Hey @sgoldenlab , it worked!!! Here is the breakdown of what I have discovered so far:\r\n1- I had to start over a few times to make sure I did everything exactly as in the tutorial, this included running a new DLCma 2.2b6 model on 1 fish\r\n2- created a new Simba project config with user defined pose config (same 7 exact body parts and labels as DLCma model) and selected multi-animal tracking (very important).\r\n3 - imported videos and DLCma h5 (obviously csv doesn't work)\r\n4 - set video parameters, corrected outliers, set ROI, extracted features and currently labeling behaviors.\r\n\r\nI have two questions about outlier correction: First, I chose the left eye and swim bladder for the body parts as they are the most obvious and reliable because the four tail labels are often off. My concern is that these structures are close together (~20px or 1mm apart) and I was wondering if I should choose the eye and tip of the tail (~120px or 5mm apart) even though the tail is tougher to track? \r\n\r\nSecond, I chose movement and location corrections of 0.7 and 1.5, respectively (it was in the bioRx pre print). Given the small size of the animals (5mm larvae in a 30x30mm arena, filmed at 1024x1024 resolution) does this seem reasonable?\r\n\r\nA suggestion about the behavior labeling GUI: the navigation hotkeys are very counter-intuitive (o,e,w,t,s,x). Is there any way to use the actual arrow keys for single frame advance, alt+arrow for 10 frames, tab+arrow for 1 sec? This physical arrangement would make it easier to navigate video without having to constantly refer to the legend for hotkeys spread out across the keyboard. Or you could group all the reverse keys together and the forward keys together but mirroring each other in space and function: w = -10 fr, e = -2 fr , r = -1sec, then u = +1sec, i =+2fr, o = +10fr. I'm not sure if this is feasible but something like this might speed up the labeling process.\r\n\r\nthanks again for all the help. I will keep you posted on the progress and let me know if you would like any files to add to the OSF database.\r\n",

Currently, the outlier correction tools struggle when users have user-defined body-parts + multi animal tracking. I have written a fix but the main scripts are not yet calling this new outlier correction function. In your case you only have one animal as I understand, so it will be fine, but as you introduce more animals you might hit an error. I hope to get this in towards end of August..\r\n\r\nFor the body-parts I don't have a good answer, I think you need to try both ways. The tail end seems more intuitive but it will be no use if it's frequently and massively off. \r\n\r\nI updated Simba with your suggested keyboard shortcuts (w,e,r and (u,i,o) - you should see it if you upgrade Simba to 1.2.11.

I used the original bx.h5 files instead of a bx.filtered.h5 files because I wanted to see how the Simba models performed. I suppose I could use the filtered data to see if the tail markers are more stable and reliable. Unfortunately, it is not always clear (to me) how the various GUI options in DLC can truly optimize tracking results. However, the models generated by the new DLCma software for a single fish are FAR SUPERIOR to the tracking generated by previous software versions. Once I optimize the tracking and behavioral classification results for one fish, I plan to add in videos with 2+ fish to see how well everything holds up.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of behaviors, my first SiMBA model only had one behavior (positive rheotaxis = orienting and swimming into water flow). Should I have created two or more behaviors to give Simba a \"choice\" for the trees or is one behavior classification enough to begin learning the software? I assumed one behavior could be a yes/no sort of decision tree.\r\n\r\nWow, thanks for incorporating my suggestions. I am excited to see where all of this ML stuff goes and how I can implement it into ethological studies with wildlife in more natural settings. I like your idea of making all the classifiers open access so that we can compare apples to apples across studies. This is part of my motivation to create a \"universal\" larval zebrafish rheotaxis assay with a fundamental appeal to biomed and wildlife/eco researchers.\r\n",

If you have Linux machine you should be good to go though.  \r\n\r\nOne classifier is good enough - it is boolean yes/no - but, SimBA will give you a probability value that the behavior is occurring in each frame, and you titrate the `discrimination threshold` to get the yes/no decision division exactly right: https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/Scenario1.md#critical-validation-step-before-running-machine-model-on-new-data.

If it is the case that it's always from, we can insert a couple of lines in the feature extraction script:  check the movements of all body-parts along Y normalized to body-part movements along X, this would come close to the answer I think?

This way SimBA will focus on swim speed and body-part movements, rtather than pick up some spurious relationships between where in the arena your animal is and the annotations. \r\n\r\nIt is an \"iterative process\" forever :)  but I think that you will be able to get a classifier that performs well for your behavior relatively quickly. PS. The number of estimators, in my experience, rather quickly reaches ceiling and 2k can often be overkill in our settings.\r\n\r\n",

This should be an easy one - however, SimBA-related questions are coming thicker and faster and I may not be able to answer very fast, especially if it's more complex. \r\n\r\nI good indication of whats going on is in this tutorial: https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/Scenario4.md\r\n\r\nWhat has happened is that you have added more videos, you need to extract the features for these files too before you start annotating these new videos. When you press `Extract features`, SimBA looks in your `project_folder/csv/outlier_corrected_movement_location` and process each csv in this folder, and saves the file in the `project_folder/csv/features_extracted` directory. \r\n\r\nTo extract the features for your new files, and no other files, I would look in your  `project_folder/csv/outlier_corrected_movement_location` folder, and remove the files you have already processed features for (perhaps create a new folder called `temp` and move your already processed files in there: that way, SimBA can no longer see them and won't process them again). Then open your project in SimBA, load your project, and press `Extract features`. Your new features files should appear in your `features_extracted` folder. Let me know how that goes!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I suggest swapping their placement to ensure people have a logical top to bottom workflow. This would also mimic the placement within the GUI of importing videos then data when you originally created the project file.\r\n\r\n2- When labeling behaviors, I like using the arrow buttons and jump advance below the frame display. Clicking on a single frame advance is nice when precisely labeling, but the immediate proximity of the single frame advance to the first/last frame buttons makes it easy to accidentally go the the beginning/end of the video. Then I have to hunt through 6000 frames to find where I was unless I remember the frame number. My suggestion is to make the buttons a little bigger and separate them a bit so that folks don't get themselves lost. Maybe the buttons are small because I am using 4K monitors? \r\n\r\nJust my $0.02.\r\n\r\n",

The model has changed due to adding new videos but it is still misidentifying negative rheotaxis (swimming with the flow) as positive rheotaxis (swimming against the flow). \r\n\r\nRecall that the videos are shot from above and the flow goes from top to bottom, so positive rheotaxis is swimming with a \"northward\", \"upward\", or 12 o'clock orientation. DLC defines a northern oriented body segment as both 0 and 360 degrees (a full circle), then the acceptable range of rheotactic orientation angles would be from 0-45 degrees and 325-360 degrees. \r\n\r\nDoes that make sense?\r\n",

The feature you mention, and the features I mentioned earlier, should be enough to get to the classifications you need. \r\n\r\nI think the only way to handle it is to use this function in the development wheel of SimBA (`pip install simba-uw-tf-dev`, where you apply your own feature extraction script that calculates the metrics you need):\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50497030/89716147-736f0e80-d95f-11ea-8c1c-c78b51d1516e.png)\r\n\r\nFor more information, check this doc think this scenario is partly what it is meant for: https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/extractFeatures.md\r\n\r\nI could help you write the first feature extraction script, it shouldn't take me very long (maybe next weekend) - this function needs to be piloted more anyways and this seems like a good opportunity, but you'll need to share the project with me - perhaps zipped through a gdrive if very large - snilsson@uw.edu  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  ",

This is the error: \r\n\r\nIn your SLP file all the animal detections get assigned a track. For example, in your first frame, SLP finds two tracks named `1857` and `1858`, which is all good. These tracks  persist for a few frames but then SLEAP finds new tracks, with new identities, and SimBA struggles to to which tracks are relevant, and which isn't in the end, and therefore fails to create the correct number of headings in the output data frame. For example, in frame 1-2 it looks good, but then already at frame 3 we have an issue, with a third track available:  \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50497030/88697092-f028ff80-d0b8-11ea-987c-bc2120132021.png)\r\n\r\nSimBA could handle this by dropping the track with the lowest probability, but then we encounter another issue: the top 2 tracks in many images keep changing names, we don't know who is who any more: for example in the second to last frame the top two tracks are called `1912` and `1922` - and I can't tell, for example, if the original  `1858` is track `1922` or `1912`, or neither of them There may be a fix for this (beyond better tracking but I don't know how to handle it in SimBA at the moment... 🤔)\r\n\r\n",

First I don't have an intimidate idea for a fix and will need to know more. \r\n\r\nThe cause is SimBA looking for the associated video file name which is stored inside of the SLP file (it is typically stored in a dictionary called `provenance` within an entry called `video.path`), and SimBA can't find this entry, and it breaks. \r\n\r\nThe reason could be that SLEAP has changed their SLP structure slightly (for naming and structure), or the `video.path` entry is only generated when SLP files are created through some architectures, not others, for example. \r\n\r\nIt's difficult for me to troubleshoot from scratch, as I'd have to try and recreate your tracking model. Would you mind sharing your SLP file you are trying to import to a gdrive link? It would be much quicker for me to find out the cause that way. Thanks! \r\n\r\n",

SimBA filled in all the data for \"track 14\" and \"track 15\", and then generated two further empty tracks (track 0-1) because it assumed those animals where in your dataset and they were occluded. \r\n\r\nSo you ended up with 4 tracks, but only a dataframe big enough for 2 tracks, so it failed and threw you that error msg. \r\n\r\nPS.

Using the .slp file found on the \"\\predictions\" folder in SLEAP works well to solve the mispositioned labels and video.path errors in SIMBA but has a major caveat: corrections to the inference in SLEAP (which are much needed to refine the tracking/labeling and avoid the extract features errors in SIMBA) will not be saved into the predictions .slp. \r\n\r\nWould there be a way for SIMBA users to import the main .slp or .h5 from SLEAP (which allows saving changes/updates to labels/tracking) without the mispositioned labels? Or is there another solution to this (perhapas in SLEAP)?",

So if I understand correctly - after running inference on the video, SLEAP saves two separate h5 SLP files - one with additional track corrections and one without track corrections, and SimBA only works on the one without? The file we worked on earlier, was that the SLP file with corrections? I'm trying to get my head around the idea why SLEAP would save a SLP with erroneous tracks. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I have other pressing things happening at the lab at the moment, so I won't be able to dig deep into this right now but will help as much I can.  I think it is important to get SimBA working properly on the correct output file from SLEAP though, so we will have to figure out what the differences are between the two containers.\r\n\r\n",

However, that was the file I had sent you previously and that created the mispositioned labels in SIMBA (and originated the video.path error before v1.2.9 update).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, whenever you run an inference on SLEAP, a prediction .slp is also generated in a \"/predictions\" folder. That file cannot be updated by subsequent changes to the inference result. However, when loading this file into SIMBA we get the labels in the correct position (and the video.path error does not occur, regardless of the file names). (but, as reported, has the caveat of not allowing prediction's refinement, which is crucial)\r\n\r\nOn top of that, it is also possible to export a .h5 file from \"File/Export Analysis HDF5\". But SIMBA cannot load this file.",

Since I have 2 animals, I first run for \"center1\", and it generated one picture for all my videos, so I though the problem was solved. But then, when I run for \"center2\", one picture is missing for my last video. \r\n\r\nFYI:\r\nThe resolution of the videos for which I failed to obtain a heat map yesterday (the program stopped after having generated the HM of the first video) picture is:\r\n<img width=\"607\" alt=\"Schermata 2020-07-25 alle 09 47 35\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66886884/88452054-e3f43680-ce5b-11ea-9dc6-a6921b03ad3c.png\">\r\n\r\nThe resolution of the videos I worked with this morning:\r\n<img width=\"396\" alt=\"Schermata 2020-07-25 alle 09 49 58\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66886884/88452106-39c8de80-ce5c-11ea-8077-c41e86884172.png\">\r\n\r\nI have the feeling that the resolution of my videos is very low, and that can be very problematic. Actually it's because I cropped a subfield of my raw videos, so the remaining portion on which I'm focusing for working ends up with a pretty bad resolution. \r\nBtw, turning back to my original problem that concerned the issue I have to extract de features, I don't think that the pre process tutorial can help me. I already did what is explained there for all my videos: cropping and splitting my files before working on it. So I actually don't know how I will be able to build classifiers from these files. \r\nLet me know if you have some ideas, \r\nThanks! ",

However, SimBA then tries to remove your pose-estimation columns and just keep the features. SimBA begins, for example, to look for a column called, for example, 'Ear_left_x' to discard it, and it can't find it, thereby the error. If you open your csv file in excel (if it is not to large) you can take a peek on what your body-parts in fact are called, which may help you troubleshoot what have gone wrong,  i.e.: \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50497030/88232426-af4d6880-cc2a-11ea-84f2-6cce34053a30.png)\r\n",

The `\\training-datasets\\iteration-0\\UnaugmentedDataSet` folder typically does not store pose estimation tracking data (unless you moved a video in there and then analyzed it, which is a little unusual), but rather it stores **your annotations** which is used to train DLC models. In order words, the file you may be trying to import into SimBA may look a little like this (if opening the .csv version of the file), and contain the coordinates of your own mouse clicks during annotations in DLC (you are likely to have less empty cells than this, but I just want to make the point):\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50497030/86857701-ee4cbd00-c073-11ea-8345-7103209007ec.png)\r\n\r\nWhat we need to import into SimBA from maDLC it the H5 file generated when analyzing a video in DLC. This file will be located in the same folder as the video file you analyzed. For example, in this screenshot below, I have analyzed a video in maDLC called \"Together1.mp4\" using the \"skeleton\" option in DLC:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50497030/86858036-b1cd9100-c074-11ea-8b61-a82f38225aa5.png)\r\n\r\nIn the SimBA interface you tell which option you used to analyze the file in DLC (skeleton or box). If you used \"skeleton\" in DLC, then you h5 files will be tagged with a file ending  \"_sk.h5\", as in my example screenshoot above. If you used box, then the files will be tagged with a file ending \"_bx.h5\". If you tell SimBA you used a skeleton setting, then SimBA is looking for files in your selected folder ending with \"_sk.h5\". I think that part of the issue you are having is that you are pointing SimBA to a folder that does not contain any \"_sk.h5\" files. Let me know if this makes sense! Thanks\r\n\r\n\r\n",

When SimBA then tried to calculate features that requires 2d (like the millimeter area of the animal), this error happens, as we can't calculate the area when the coordinates fall on one dimension. \r\n\r\nI wrote a FAQ that mentions this error but I forgot to link to it on the main page:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/SimBA_no_TF/docs/FAQ.md\r\n\r\nThere may also be some relevant info how to solve it on the gitter page if you search for 'qhull'. \r\n\r\nThe typical reason is that your first image in your video does not contain an animal, or the animal is covered by the experimenter hand or similar, and the pose tool has placed all the body-parts, for example, in the top left corner of the image. You can solve this by cutting those early parts of the video out  before anslysis. If that's not the case, it may be that something has gone wrong in the outlier correction step, and you may want to make your outlier criteria less strongest (increase the criteria values).\r\n\r\nLet me know if that fixes it or not!\r\n\r\n\r\n",

You can try and skip wxpython installation. Try to install SimBA without tensorflow and in-build DeepLabCut/DeepPoseKit menus - `pip install simba-uw-no-tf`  \r\n\r\nThanks",

Also make sure that you don't have two rows with the same video name: \"the series to class int\" suggests that SimBA finds multiple rows in the video_info.csv file with the same video name, and can't convert the multiple instances to a single fps integer number. \r\n\r\nIf the error still persists, then also make sure that your video file names does not contain any spaces.\r\n\r\nLet me know id that fixes the issue!",

Then if it is invalid, setting the value to default (while telling the user) or making the user choose again. This would save some users (like me) from their own ignorance and others from wasting time training a machine model that will ultimately not be saved, because the validation process causes an error and everything is gone.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nAn alternative would be to validate the settings before starting the training. Simply throwing out an error (e.g. \"ValueError: Some of your parameters are invalid. Consider reading the readme files again.\")\r\n\r\nAnother alternative would be to check user input when pressing the save button. Similiar to a contact formular on a website. I guess this would take much more time (as it's related to gui programming) though.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI would not document this kind of request if your overall goal wasn't to create a tool that can be used without any (or without a lot of) programming experience. SimBa is already simplifying a complicated process so much and it is doing great work! \r\n\r\n",

The step thus has failed.\r\n \r\n\r\nPossible reason and working empiric fix:\r\n\r\nThe postures were analysed separately using DeepLabCut (not via SimBA pipeline), and then the .csv files with coordinates from DeepLabCut were loaded into the the resulting .csv files. Thus, the names of those files (something like \"Dec0419_Trial1DLC_resnet50_resident_intruder_optogeneticsFeb14shuffle1_600000.csv\") were not the same as the names of the movies loaded into the project (\"Dec0419_Trial1.mp4\"). The former names were listed in the log files  project_folder\\log\\Outliers_location_nnnnnnn.csv and project_folder\\log\\Outliers_movement_nnnnnnnnnn.csv, but the latter (simpler) movie  names were listed in the file project_folder\\log\\video_info.csv\r\nThe issue was resolved by pasting the values of the movie names from Outliers_*.csv log files into the video_info.csv log file.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nOlexiy.",

If you download SimBA again this error has been fixed. \r\n\r\nAs you say, in the video_info.csv - make sure all the videos meta data and correct video file names are stored before proceeding through outlier correction and feature extraction steps.

        "body": "Bumps [tensorflow-gpu](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) from 1.14.0 to 1.15.2.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n\n*Sourced from [tensorflow-gpu's releases](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases).*\n\n> ## TensorFlow 1.15.2\n> # Release 1.15.2\r\n> \r\n> Note that this release no longer has a single pip package for GPU and CPU. Please see [#36347](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/36347) for history and details\r\n> \r\n> ## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\r\n> * Fixes a security vulnerability where converting a Python string to a `tf.float16` value produces a segmentation fault ([CVE-2020-5215](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-5215))\r\n> * Updates `curl` to `7.66.0` to handle [CVE-2019-5482](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-5482) and [CVE-2019-5481](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-5481)\r\n> * Updates `sqlite3` to `3.30.01` to handle [CVE-2019-19646](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-19646), [CVE-2019-19645](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-19645) and [CVE-2019-16168](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-16168)\n> \n> ## TensorFlow 1.15.0\n> # Release 1.15.0\r\n> This is the last 1.x release for TensorFlow. We do not expect to update the 1.x branch with features, although we will issue patch releases to fix vulnerabilities for at least one year.\r\n> \r\n> ## Major Features and Improvements\r\n> * As [announced](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/forum/#!topic/developers/iRCt5m4qUz0), `tensorflow` pip package will by default include GPU support (same as `tensorflow-gpu` now) for the platforms we currently have GPU support (Linux and Windows). It will work on machines with and without Nvidia GPUs. `tensorflow-gpu` will still be available, and CPU-only packages can be downloaded at `tensorflow-cpu` for users who are concerned about package size.\r\n> * TensorFlow 1.15 contains a complete implementation of the 2.0 API in its `compat.v2` module. It contains a copy of the 1.15 main module (without `contrib`) in the `compat.v1` module. TensorFlow 1.15 is able to emulate 2.0 behavior using the `enable_v2_behavior()` function.\r\n> This enables writing forward compatible code: by explicitly importing either `tensorflow.compat.v1` or `tensorflow.compat.v2`, you can ensure that your code works without modifications against an installation of 1.15 or 2.0.\r\n> * `EagerTensor` now supports numpy buffer interface for tensors.\r\n> * Add toggles `tf.enable_control_flow_v2()` and `tf.disable_control_flow_v2()` for enabling/disabling v2 control flow.\r\n> * Enable v2 control flow as part of `tf.enable_v2_behavior()` and `TF2_BEHAVIOR=1`.\r\n> * AutoGraph translates Python control flow into TensorFlow expressions, allowing users to write regular Python inside `tf.function`-decorated functions. AutoGraph is also applied in functions used with `tf.data`, `tf.distribute` and `tf.keras` APIS.\r\n> * Adds `enable_tensor_equality()`, which switches the behavior such that: \r\n>   * Tensors are no longer hashable.\r\n>   * Tensors can be compared with `==` and `!=`, yielding a Boolean Tensor with element-wise comparison results. This will be the default behavior in 2.0.\r\n> * Auto Mixed-Precision graph optimizer simplifies converting models to `float16` for acceleration on Volta and Turing Tensor Cores. This feature can be enabled by wrapping an optimizer class with `tf.train.experimental.enable_mixed_precision_graph_rewrite()`.\r\n> * Add environment variable `TF_CUDNN_DETERMINISTIC`. Setting to \"true\" or \"1\" forces the selection of deterministic cuDNN convolution and max-pooling algorithms. When this is enabled, the algorithm selection procedure itself is also deterministic.\r\n> * TensorRT\r\n>   * Migrate TensorRT conversion sources from contrib to compiler directory in preparation for TF 2.0.\r\n>   * Add additional, user friendly `TrtGraphConverter` API for TensorRT conversion.\r\n>   * Expand support for TensorFlow operators in TensorRT conversion (e.g.\r\n>     `Gather`, `Slice`, `Pack`, `Unpack`, `ArgMin`, `ArgMax`,`DepthSpaceShuffle`). \r\n>   * Support TensorFlow operator `CombinedNonMaxSuppression` in TensorRT conversion which \r\n>      significantly accelerates object detection models.\r\n> \r\n> ## Breaking Changes\r\n> * Tensorflow code now produces 2 different pip packages: `tensorflow_core` containing all the code (in the future it will contain only the private implementation) and `tensorflow` which is a virtual pip package doing forwarding to `tensorflow_core` (and in the future will contain only the public API of tensorflow). We don't expect this to be breaking, unless you were importing directly from the implementation.\r\n> * TensorFlow 1.15 is built using devtoolset7 (GCC7) on Ubuntu 16. This may lead to ABI incompatibilities with extensions built against earlier versions of TensorFlow.\r\n> * Deprecated the use of `constraint=` and `.constraint` with ResourceVariable.\r\n> * `tf.keras`:\r\n>   * `OMP_NUM_THREADS` is no longer used by the default Keras config. To configure the number of threads, use `tf.config.threading` APIs.\r\n>   * `tf.keras.model.save_model` and `model.save` now defaults to saving a TensorFlow SavedModel.\r\n>   * `keras.backend.resize_images` (and consequently, `keras.layers.Upsampling2D`) behavior has changed, a bug in the resizing implementation was fixed.\r\n>   * Layers now default to `float32`, and automatically cast their inputs to the layer's dtype. If you had a model that used `float64`, it will probably silently use `float32` in TensorFlow2, and a warning will be issued that starts with Layer \"layer-name\" is casting an input tensor from dtype float64 to the layer's dtype of float32. To fix, either set the default dtype to float64 with `tf.keras.backend.set_floatx('float64')`, or pass `dtype='float64'` to each of the Layer constructors. See `tf.keras.layers.Layer` for more information.\r\n>   * Some `tf.assert_*` methods now raise assertions at operation creation time (i.e. when this Python line executes) if the input tensors' values are known at that time, not during the session.run(). When this happens, a noop is returned and the input tensors are marked non-feedable. In other words, if they are used as keys in `feed_dict` argument to `session.run()`, an error will be raised. Also, because some assert ops don't make it into the graph, the graph structure changes. A different graph can result in different per-op random seeds when they are not given explicitly (most often).\r\n> \r\n> ## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\r\n> * `tf.estimator`:\r\n>   * `tf.keras.estimator.model_to_estimator` now supports exporting to `tf.train.Checkpoint` format, which allows the saved checkpoints to be compatible with `model.load_weights`.\r\n>   * Fix tests in canned estimators.\r\n></tr></table> ...

Python 2 support [officially ends an January 1, 2020](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/#update). [As announced earlier](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/msg/announce/gVwS5RC8mds/dCt1ka2XAAAJ), TensorFlow will also stop supporting Python 2 starting January 1, 2020, and no more releases are expected in 2019.\n> \n> ## Major Features and Improvements\n> * The `tensorflow` pip package now includes GPU support by default (same as `tensorflow-gpu`) for both Linux and Windows. This runs on machines with and without NVIDIA GPUs. `tensorflow-gpu` is still available, and CPU-only packages can be downloaded at `tensorflow-cpu` for users who are concerned about package size.\n> * **Windows users:** Officially-released `tensorflow` Pip packages are now built with Visual Studio 2019 version 16.4 in order to take advantage of the new `/d2ReducedOptimizeHugeFunctions` compiler flag. To use these new packages, you must install \"Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019\", available from Microsoft's website [here](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads).\n>   * This does not change the minimum required version for building TensorFlow from source on Windows, but builds enabling `EIGEN_STRONG_INLINE` can take over 48 hours to compile without this flag. Refer to `configure.py` for more information about `EIGEN_STRONG_INLINE` and `/d2ReducedOptimizeHugeFunctions`.\n>   * If either of the required DLLs, `msvcp140.dll` (old) or `msvcp140_1.dll` (new), are missing on your machine, `import tensorflow` will print a warning message.\n> * The `tensorflow` pip package is built with CUDA 10.1 and cuDNN 7.6.\n> * `tf.keras`\n>   * Experimental support for mixed precision is available on GPUs and Cloud TPUs. See [usage guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/mixed_precision).\n>   * Introduced the `TextVectorization` layer, which takes as input raw strings and takes care of text standardization, tokenization, n-gram generation, and vocabulary indexing. See this [end-to-end text classification example](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1RvCnR7h0_l4Ekn5vINWToI9TNJdpUZB3).\n>   * Keras `.compile` `.fit` `.evaluate` and `.predict` are allowed to be outside of the DistributionStrategy scope, as long as the model was constructed inside of a scope.\n>   * Experimental support for Keras `.compile`, `.fit`, `.evaluate`, and `.predict` is available for Cloud TPUs, Cloud TPU, for all types of Keras models (sequential, functional and subclassing models).\n>   * Automatic outside compilation is now enabled for Cloud TPUs. This allows `tf.summary` to be used more conveniently with Cloud TPUs.\n>   * Dynamic batch sizes with DistributionStrategy and Keras are supported on Cloud TPUs.\n>   * Support for `.fit`, `.evaluate`, `.predict` on TPU using numpy data, in addition to `tf.data.Dataset`.\n>   * Keras reference implementations for many popular models are available in the TensorFlow [Model Garden](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official).\n> * `tf.data`\n>   * Changes rebatching for `tf.data datasets` + DistributionStrategy for better performance. Note that the dataset also behaves slightly differently, in that the rebatched dataset cardinality will always be a multiple of the number of replicas.\n>   * `tf.data.Dataset` now supports automatic data distribution and sharding in distributed environments, including on TPU pods.\n>   * Distribution policies for `tf.data.Dataset` can now be tuned with 1. `tf.data.experimental.AutoShardPolicy(OFF, AUTO, FILE, DATA)` 2. `tf.data.experimental.ExternalStatePolicy(WARN, IGNORE, FAIL)`\n> * `tf.debugging`\n>   * Add `tf.debugging.enable_check_numerics()` and `tf.debugging.disable_check_numerics()` to help debugging the root causes of issues involving infinities and `NaN`s.\n> * `tf.distribute`\n>   * Custom training loop support on TPUs and TPU pods is avaiable through `strategy.experimental_distribute_dataset`, `strategy.experimental_distribute_datasets_from_function`, `strategy.experimental_run_v2`, `strategy.reduce`.\n>   * Support for a global distribution strategy through `tf.distribute.experimental_set_strategy(),` in addition to `strategy.scope()`.\n> * `TensorRT`\n>   * [TensorRT 6.0](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt#tensorrt-whats-new) is now supported and enabled by default. This adds support for more TensorFlow ops including Conv3D, Conv3DBackpropInputV2, AvgPool3D, MaxPool3D, ResizeBilinear, and ResizeNearestNeighbor. In addition, the TensorFlow-TensorRT python conversion API is exported as `tf.experimental.tensorrt.Converter`.\n> * Environment variable `TF_DETERMINISTIC_OPS` has been added. When set to \"true\" or \"1\", this environment variable makes `tf.nn.bias_add` operate deterministically (i.e. reproducibly), but currently only when XLA JIT compilation is *not* enabled. Setting `TF_DETERMINISTIC_OPS` to \"true\" or \"1\" also makes cuDNN convolution and max-pooling operate deterministically. This makes Keras Conv\\*D and MaxPool\\*D layers operate deterministically in both the forward and backward directions when running on a CUDA-enabled GPU.\n> \n> ## Breaking Changes\n> * Deletes `Operation.traceback_with_start_lines` for which we know of no usages.\n> * Removed `id` from `tf.Tensor.__repr__()` as `id` is not useful other than internal debugging.\n> * Some `tf.assert_*` methods now raise assertions at operation creation time if the input tensors' values are known at that time, not during the `session.run()`. This only changes behavior when the graph execution would have resulted in an error. When this happens, a noop is returned and the input tensors are marked non-feedable. In other words, if they are used as keys in `feed_dict` argument to `session.run()`, an error will be raised. Also, because some assert ops don't make it into the graph, the graph structure changes. A different graph can result in different per-op random seeds when they are not given explicitly (most often).\n> * The following APIs are not longer experimental: `tf.config.list_logical_devices`, `tf.config.list_physical_devices`, `tf.config.get_visible_devices`, `tf.config.set_visible_devices`, `tf.config.get_logical_device_configuration`, `tf.config.set_logical_device_configuration`.\n> * `tf.config.experimentalVirtualDeviceConfiguration` has been renamed to `tf.config.LogicalDeviceConfiguration`.\n> * `tf.config.experimental_list_devices` has been removed, please use\n> `tf.config.list_logical_devices`.\n> \n> ## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n></tr></table> ...
