Code contributions
==========================================================

SimBA was originally written in the Sam Golden lab at the University of Washington during 2019-2020, by postdoc `Simon Nilsson <https://github.com/sronilsson>`_
with the help from lab manager `Jia Jie Choong <https://github.com/inoejj>`_. A related plotly dashboard (not maintained as of 2020)
was also written by `Sophia Hwang <https://github.com/sophihwang26>`_ and `Aasiya Islam <https://github.com/aasiya-islam>`_.

The code written in the Sam Golden lab is no longer maintained or supported by any individuals, documentation, or repository.
The code written in the Sam Golden lab is not object-oriented and modular. If needed, the code be found by installing `simba-uw-tf-dev` version prior to `0.77.0` through pypi.

`Simon Nilsson <https://github.com/sronilsson>`_ left the Golden lab in 2020 - and since then - he maintains SimBA in his spare time.
As of October 2020, the SimBA codebase, SimBA Github repository, SimBA pip package, SimBA API, SimBA documentation, and SimBA supports channels, are maintained
and developed exclusively by Simon, without grants, hardware or other support. This development would not be possible without the
collaborative and friendly open-source community with their expert feedback and suggestions!
