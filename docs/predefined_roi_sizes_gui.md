Once clicked, you should see the following pop-up opening allowing you to draw a range of different shapes with specified sizes. If you need a shape-type that is missing, consider letting us know through [Gitter](https://app.gitter.im/#/room/#SimBA-Resource_community:gitter.im) or by opening en issue on [GithHub](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=feature_request.md&title=).
