==========================================================

SimBA extracts features for building and `running downstream machine
learning
models <https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/tutorial.md#step-5-extract-features>`__.
However, at times, we may just want to take advantage of some SimBA
`feature
calculators <https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/simba/mixins/feature_extraction_mixin.py>`__
and generate a subset of measurements for use in our own downstream
applications. For some of the feature sub-sets available, see the image
above.

INSTRUCTIONS
---------------------------

1) To create feature sub-sets, first import your pose-esimation data
   into SimBA and follow the instruction up-to and **including** outlier
   correction as documented in the `Scenario 1
   tutorial <https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/Scenario1.md>`__.
   Before calculating feature sub-sets in SimBA, ensure that the
   ``project_folder/csv/outlier_corrected_movement_location`` directory
   of your SimBA project is populated with files.

2). Navigate to the [Extract features] tab, and click on the
``CALCULATE FEATURE SUBSETS`` button.

3) In the ``FEATURE FAMILY`` drop-down, select the type of measurements
   you want to calculate.

.. note::
   If you find a set of features is missing from the drop-down, let us know by opening a `GitHub
   issue <https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/issues>`__ or reach out to
   us on `Gitter <https://gitter.im/SimBA-Resource/community>`__ and we
   will work to get it in.

4). In the ``SAVE DIRECTORY`` selection box, select a directory where
you want to save your feature data. Itâ€™s a good idea to select an empty
directory.

5). Once filled in, hit the ``RUN`` button. You can follow the progress
in the main SimBA window.

6). Once complete, the ``SAVE DIRECTORY`` will be filled with one file
for every video file represented in your
``project_folder/csv/outlier_corrected_movement_location`` directory. In
these files, every row represents a frame, and every column represents a
feature in feature family. The number of columns (features) will depend
on the number of body-parts and animals in your SimBA project.

For smaller examples of expected output, see:

   (mm).csv <https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/misc/Two-point%20body-part%20distances%20(mm).csv>`__
