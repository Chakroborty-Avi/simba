## STEP 1

The first tab in this pop-up is named `Create Dataset`. We will use this tab to create a single-file dataset with all our supervised classifications. 
This file will then be used throughout the rest of the pipeline to build and analyze dimensionality reduction and clustering models. There are some user-defined options for how this file should be created:

In the `Feature slice` dropdown. Select which fields you want SimBA to use when creating the dataset, the options are 'ALL FEATURES (EXCLUDING POSE)', 'ALL FEATURES (INCLUDING POSE)', 'USER-DEFINED FEATURE SET'.
