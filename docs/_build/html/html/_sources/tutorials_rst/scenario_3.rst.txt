Scenario 3 walkthrough
===============

To faciliate the initial use of SimBA, we provide several use scenarios.
We have created these scenarios around a hypothetical experiment that
take a user from initial use (completely new start) all the way through
analyzing a complete experiment and then adding additional experimental
datasets to an initial project.

All scenarios assume that the videos have been
`pre-processed <https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/tutorial_process_videos.md>`__
and that `DLC behavioral tracking .CSV
dataframes <https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/Tutorial_DLC.md>`__
have been created.

**Hypothetical Experiment**:
============================

Three days of resident-intruder testing between aggressive CD-1 mice and
subordinante C57 intruders. Each day of testing has 10 pairs of mice,
for a total of 30 videos recorded across 3 days. Recordings are 3
minutes in duration, in color, at 30fps.

**Scenario 3**: Updating a classifier with further annotated data.
==================================================================

In this Scenario you have generated a classifier using SimBA, but its
possible (or, likely) that the classifier could be improved by including
more training data. We suggest that you iterate between Scenario 1 and
Scenerio 3 a few times before using a classifier on Experimental data,
as done in Scenario 2. The goal is that you will only need to create a
classifier once, so the better it is before experimental use, the less
work you will have to do in the future!

   **Note 1**: If you have received a classifier from another lab, or
   have notably changed the experimental recording configuration in your
   own lab, you will likely need create a new version of your classifier
   that now includes training examples from your own lab’s behavioral
   setup or from the new recording conditions. While classifiers can
   genreralize well, they will always do better if the training dataset
   includes examples from your own behavioral setup! If your predictions
   are not going well with someone else’s classifier, or after you have
   changed your behavioral equipment, this is a very likely reason and
   and easy fix.

..

   **Note 2**: For the above reason, it is very important that you
   create clear operational definitions of annotated behaviors. Please
   see these examples for
   `mouse <https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/misc/Operational_definitions_mouse_resident_intruder.pdf>`__
   and
   `rat <https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/misc/Operational_definitions_rat_resident_intruder.pdf>`__
   predictive classifiers for aggressive behaviors in resident-intruder
   protocols.

   **Note 3**: If you plan to share a predictive classifier with other
   users, you will need to share the operationalized definitions, the
   ``project_folder/csv/targets_inserted`` CSV files for **all** the
   videos used in the initial training set, and the *video_info.csv*
   file generated by SimBA which is located in the
   ``project_folder\logs`` directory (further detailed below in *Part
   1*).

*HINT*: SimBA inlcudes several model evaluation tools that cant be
selected by the user when generating the predictive classfiers. Among
other things, this includes learning curves, which indicates how the
predictive classifier performs with increasing amounts of data. For more
information on how to use SimBa to generate learning curves for your
predictive classifier, click
`here <https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/Scenario1.md#step-7-train-machine-model>`__.
For more general information on learning curves in machine learning and
their potential for informing on the benefit of additional data, click
`here <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_learning_curve.html>`__.

In this tutorial, we will use SimBA to add further annotations to the
predictive classifier generated in `Scenario
1 <https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/Scenario1.md>`__,
and create an new classifier that now includes the training data from
`Scenario
1 <https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/Scenario1.md>`__
as well as the new additional data.

.. note::
   In practice, what we are doing in this Scenario is to
   generate a brand new classifier that contains previously annotated
   data as well as new annotated data, rather than building on an
   already generated classifier.

Part 1: Previously annotated CSV files.
---------------------------------------

**1. Locate the previously annotated CSV files**. We will need to start
with a project directory tree that does not contain any other data than
the data we want to use to create the new predictive classifier. If you
are coming along from `Scenario
1 <https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/edit/master/docs/Scenario1.md>`__
or `Scenario
2 <https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/edit/master/docs/Scenario2.md>`__
you will have one or more project directory trees already. The project
tree from `Scenario
1 <https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/edit/master/docs/Scenario1.md>`__
will contain critical files that we want to use when creating the new
predictive classifier in this current Scenario 3. The critical files are
located in the ``project_folder/csv/targets_inserted`` directory of the
`Scenario
1 <https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/edit/master/docs/Scenario1.md>`__
project. In this folder, there is one CSV file for each video, and each
CSV file represents a video. Each CSV file contains the (i)
pose-estimation data, (ii) the extracted features, and (iii) annotated
behaviours that were created using the `SimBA behavioral annotation
GUI <https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/Scenario1.md#step-6-label-behavior-ie-create-annotations-for-predictive-classifiers>`__.
Copy these CSV files to a safe memorable place, or alternatively, just
be aware of their location. We will use them in later in this Scenario
3.

.. note::
   If a predictive classifier has been generated by someone
   else, and you want to add further data to this classifer in order to
   generate a new classifier with more training data, you will need
   three things:

-  You will need the operational definitions of the behaviors, so that
   you can score the behaviors identically.

-  You will need the files from the *targets_inserted* folder from the
   project where the classifier was generated.

-  You will also need information on the resolution, pixels per mm, and
   fps from the videos used to create the original predictive
   classifier. This infomation is stored in the *video_info.csv* file
   generated by SimBA which is located in the ``project_folder\logs``
   directory.

-  You **do not** have to have the frames, or the video files, for the
   videos that *were used to generate the original classifier*.

Part 2: Create a project.
-------------------------

To create a new project, follow the instructions for creating a new
project in either of these tutorials:
`1 <https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/Scenario1.md#part-1-create-a-new-project-1>`__,
`2 <https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/tutorial.md#step-1-generate-project-config>`__.
Instead of importing the ‘pilot’ data as indicated in the tutorial from
`Scenario
1 <https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/Scenario1.md#part-1-create-a-new-project-1>`__,
import the pose estimation data and videos you want to ‘add’ to the
predictive classifier.

**Important I**: In the final portion of the tutorials for creating a
new project (*Step 4*), we extract the frames from the videos we have
imported into the project. Having the frames is necessery in this
current Scenario 3, as we will render them for annotating behaviors in
the `SimBA behavioral annotation
GUI <https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/Scenario1.md#step-6-label-behavior-ie-create-annotations-for-predictive-classifiers>`__.
However, you **do not** have to have the frames for the videos that
*were used to generate the original classifier*.

**Important II**: Make sure the file names of the new videos, and new
DeepLabCut pose estimation data, are not identical to the file names of
the previously annotated videos.

**Important III**: Make sure the the classifier name(s), which is
defined when `creating the
project <https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/Scenario1.md#step-1-generate-project-config>`__
in the SML Settings menu, is **the same** as the classifier name used to
create the previous classifier.

Part 3: Load project and process your new tracking data
-------------------------------------------------------

In Part 2 above, we created a project that contains the data you wish to
add to the predictive classifier. To continue working with this project,
we **must** load it. To load the project and process your new data,
follow the instructions for **Step 1-6** in either of these tutorials:
`1 <https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/Scenario1.md#part-1-create-a-new-project-1>`__,
`2 <https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/tutorial.md#step-1-generate-project-config>`__.

When you have completed **Step 1-6**, you will have (i) corrected the
outliers present in your new data, (ii) extracted features from your new
data, (iii) and annotated behaviours in your new data. For example, if
you annotated an additional, new, dataset contain 5 videos, you should
now see 5 CSV files in the ``project_folder\csv\targets_inserted``
directory.

Part 4: Add the previously annotated CSV files to your ``project_folder\csv\targets_inserted`` directory.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have now created a new project and have annotated data in this
project, and we now want to import the annotations used to create the
previous classifier into this project. **We will do this manually**.

**1. Navigate** to the folder that stores the previously annotated CSV
files (see **Part 1**). Copy and paste them into your current current
project into the ``project_folder\csv\targets_inserted`` directory.

You now have all the annotated files that will be used to create your
predictive classifier in one place.

**2. Create a new, updated, video_info.csv file**. In the the current
project directory, the *video_info.csv* file generated by SimBA, which
is located in the ``project_folder\logs`` directory, will so far only
include the information from the new videos that you wish to *add* to
the classifier. It does not contain the information from the videos that
were used to create the previous predictive classifier. To update the
*video_info.csv* file so that it contains both the new and the older
video information, first open the *video_info.csv* file from the
**earlier project** (see **Step 1**) and copy its content. Next, open
the *video_info.csv* file for the **current project** and paste the
content into the file. You should now have a *video_info.csv* that
contains a row of information for each of the CSV files represented in
the ``project_folder\csv\targets_inserted`` directory. The content of
the file may look similar to this:

.. image:: img/scenario_3/video_info.jpg
  :width: 1000
  :align: center

.. note::
   In the example screenshoot above the videos have the same
   resolution, pixels per millimeter, and fps. However, they can be in
   any different combination of values across different videos.

.. note::
   Make sure that the column *Video* (the first column on the
   left), has the names of the video files in the
   ``project_folder\csv\targets_inserted`` directory (excluding the file
   format, .csv).

Part 5: Generate a new predictive classifier with the new dataset.
------------------------------------------------------------------

You now have all the necessery data organised and you are ready to
generate a new predictive classifier that includes the data used to
generate the original classfier, plus the data from new annotated
videos. To generate a new predictive classifier with these data, see
`Step
7 <https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/Scenario1.md#step-7-train-machine-model>`__
and onwards in the `Scenario
1 <https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/Scenario1.md>`__
tutorial.

Once you have completed **Part 5** of the current Scenario 3, you may
want to proceed to either:

-  Visualize and validate the new classifier on a video not used during
   training of the classifier. For validating a classifier on a new
   video, see Scenario 1 - `Critical validation step before running
   machine model on new
   data <https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/Scenario1.md#critical-validation-step-before-running-machine-model-on-new-data>`__.

-  Run the new classifier on new data. To run the classifier on new
   data, see Scenario 2 - `Using a classifier on new experimental
   data <https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/Scenario2.md#scenario-2-using-a-classifier-on-new-experimental-data>`__.

-  Visualize machine predictions on one or several videos. To create
   visualizations, see Scenario 2 - `Visualizing machine
   predictions <https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/Scenario2.md#part-5--visualizing-machine-predictions>`__.
   *Note*: You can only visualize the predictions on videos for which
   you have extracted the frames and have feature data for. For more
   information on extracting frames - click
   `here <https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/tutorial.md#step-4-extract-frames-into-project-folder>`__.

**Congratulations! You now have a new classifier of your behavior that
is better than the original, or that has been updated from another lab’s
behavioral setup to work with your own! If you are following the
Scenarios, you also now are ready to add the next two days of
Experimental data to your project. Please see** `Scenario
4 <https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/Scenario4.md>`__
**for instructions.**
