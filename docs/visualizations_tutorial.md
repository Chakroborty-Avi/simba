## Part 5:  Visualizing machine predictions

In this part of the tutorial we will create visualizations of features and machine learning classifications that you have generated. This includes images and videos of the animals with prediction overlays, gantt plots, line plots, paths plots, heat maps and data plot. In this step the different frames can also be merged into video mp4 format. Please note that the rendering of images and videos can take up a lot of hardrive space, especially if your videos are recorded at high frame rates, are long duration, or high resolution. One suggestion, if you are short on harddrive space, is to only generate frames for a few select videos (more information below). We are currently working on updating SimBA to give the user the oppurtunity to work with compressed videos rather than frames during the `visualization` steps.
