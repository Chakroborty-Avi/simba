Behavioral experiments can involve conditioned stimuli (such as cue lights) where experimenters assess behaviors in and around the time periods of such conditioned stimuli.
For example, we may want to know:

* How many times, and for how long, is behavior X expressed during the cue light (and in user-specified time-windows preceding and proceding the cue light)?
 
* How much does the animal move during the cue light (and in user-specified time-windows preceding and proceding the cue light)? 

* Where in the environment does the animal spend time during the cue light (and in user-specified time-windows preceding and proceding the cue light)? 


In this tutorial we will use SimBA to infer when the cue light is on, and analyze movement, velocities, and behavioral classifications in relationship with the cue light status.
This tutorial involves a scenario with a single classifier, single animal and single cue light. However, note that SimBA methods supports several cue lights, multiple and and classifiers.
